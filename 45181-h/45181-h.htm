<h2><a name="EDITORS_PREFACE" id="EDITORS_PREFACE">EDITOR'S PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>In issuing this volume of a series of Handbooks on
the Artistic Crafts, it will be well to state what are
our general aims.</p>

<p>In the first place, we wish to provide trustworthy
text-books of workshop practice, from the points of
view of experts who have critically examined the
methods current in the shops, and, putting aside
vain survivals, are prepared to say what is good
workmanship and to set up a standard of quality
in the crafts which are more especially associated
with design. Secondly, in doing this, we hope to
treat design itself as an essential part of good workmanship.
During the last century most of the arts,
save painting and sculpture of an academic kind,
were little considered, and there was a tendency to
look on 'design' as a mere matter of <i>appearance</i>.
Such 'ornamentation' as there was was usually
obtained by following in a mechanical way a drawing
provided by an artist who often knew little of the
technical processes involved in production. With
the critical attention given to the crafts by Ruskin
and Morris, it came to be seen that it was impossible
to detach design from craft in this way, and
that, in the widest sense, true design is an inseparable
element of good quality, involving as it does
the selection of good and suitable material, contrivance
for special purpose, expert workmanship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
proper finish and so on, far more than mere ornament,
and, indeed, that ornamentation itself was
rather an exuberance of fine workmanship than a
matter of merely abstract lines. Workmanship
when separated by too wide a gulf from fresh
thought&mdash;that is, from design&mdash;inevitably decays,
and, on the other hand, ornamentation, divorced
from workmanship, is necessarily unreal, and quickly
falls into affectation. Proper ornamentation may be
defined as a language addressed to the eye; it is
pleasant thought expressed in the speech of the tool.</p>

<p>In the third place, we would have this series put
artistic craftsmanship before people as furnishing
reasonable occupations for those who would gain
a livelihood. Although within the bounds of
academic art the competition, of its kind, is so
acute that only a very few per cent. can fairly hope
to succeed as painters and sculptors, yet as artistic
craftsmen there is some probability that nearly
every one who would pass through a sufficient
period of apprenticeship to workmanship and design
would reach a measure of success.</p>

<p>In the blending of handwork and thought in such
arts as we propose to deal with, happy careers may
be found as far removed from the dreary routine
of hack labour as from the terrible uncertainty of
academic art. It is desirable in every way that
men of good education should be brought back into
the productive crafts: there are more than enough
of us 'in the City,' and it is probable that more
consideration will be given in this century than in
the last to Design and Workmanship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Designers have at times to deal with some matters
which are almost common to all the arts, matters
which they either know or do not know, and in
which the genius they are apt to trust in goes for
little apart from knowledge. They must learn
lettering for inscriptions much like they once learnt
the multiplication table, and they should learn the
elements of heraldry in the same way. This it has
been difficult to do, as most of the books on heraldry,
in seeking to be complete, so effectually muddle
up the few important points with the vast number
of things unimportant, or worse, that the art student
is likely to give it up in despair. Many books on
heraldry, which in itself is surely a gay thing, have
been made to resemble grammars and dictionaries of
a meaningless jargon.</p>

<p>Any student, however, who has become interested
in a single shield, or in the look of the thing as seen
in a collection of fine examples of heraldry such as
are illustrated in this volume, should be able to
master the main principles in an hour or two. The
curious terms are only old-fashioned; they are used,
so far as they are necessary, not of malice, but
because it is of the essence of heraldry that everything
shall be so strictly defined that a few words may
represent a shield of arms as surely as a picture.
Hence everything has a name, everything is clear,
sharp, and bright, the colours are few, the forms
must be large and simple. Even the seemingly
arbitrary dictum that 'no colour must be put on
colour or metal on metal' may probably have arisen
from the fact that when gilding or silvering was
used on a shield it would form a perfect foil for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
colours, but as they reflected light in the same
way, they could not be distinguished if used one on
the other. Even yellow pigment on white would
not tell clearly at any distance; the maxim is merely
a rule for the sake of distinctness. Again, the
curious vigorous drawing of beasts and birds with
the eyes staring and the feet spread out was not the
result of a desire to be quaint, but arose naturally
from the same need of being clear. A good
naturalistic drawing of a lion would be useless on a
flag. Granted the special needs of heraldry, it
developed in a perfectly understandable way.</p>

<p>On the question of heraldic drawing I should like
to caution the student against thinking that it is so
easy as it looks. Elementary and exaggerated, it
may seem as if any child might do it, but in truth
it is terribly difficult. The old shields were designed
by experts with great experience; they placed the
charge perfectly on the field and so distributed the
parts that they were balanced in 'weight'; there
were no weak lines and nothing was crowded for
lack of room. Much practice made them perfect,
and perfection is still difficult.</p>

<p>The present volume seems to me exactly what
artists have wanted.</p>

<h2><a name="AUTHORS_PREFACE" id="AUTHORS_PREFACE">AUTHOR'S PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This book is an attempt to place before designers
and craftsmen such an account of the principles
of the art of Heraldry as will enable them to work
out for themselves the many and various applications
of it that are possible to-day.</p>

<p>To that end the different usages which have
prevailed from time to time are dealt with in detail,
and are illustrated as far as may be from ancient
sources.</p>

<p>Should it be thought that undue stress has been
laid upon the pre-Tudor heraldry, to the comparative
exclusion of that of later times, it may be pointed
out that until the principles of the earlier heraldry
have been grasped and appreciated, it is impossible
to get rid of the cast-iron uniformity and stupid
rules that bound the heraldry of to-day, and tend to
strangle all attempts to raise it to a higher level.</p>

<p>To what extent these chilling ideas prevail, and
how necessary it is to get rid of them, cannot better
be illustrated than by two letters written to the
author, after most of the following chapters were in
type, by a critical friend who has not read any of
them.</p>

<p>He points out in his first letter that on the very
day of his writing there had been brought to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
notice, not for the first time, the great need that
exists for a book in which sculptors and painters
may find out what they legitimately may and what
they may not do as regards heraldry. What, for
example, may be left out from an achievement of
arms, and how the different elements composing it
may be varied, or even rearranged.</p>

<p>He instances the case of a sculptor who had been
supplied with a drawing, 'brilliant in emerald green
and powder blue,' of the arms that had been granted
to a famous Englishman whose memory was about
to be honoured by the setting up of a statue with
his arms, etc. carved upon the pedestal.</p>

<p>The arms in the drawing did not present any
difficulties, but the crest was not shown upon the
helm, and the whole was surrounded by a series of
trophies which to this unenlightened sculptor were
as heraldic as the arms and crest. Out of all this,
asked the sculptor, what could lawfully be omitted?
If any of the trophies were supporters, must they be
shown? And must the crest be used? Ought
the crest to be on a helm? And should the helm
be shown in profile or full-faced?</p>

<p>The contents of the drawing, if all were sculptured,
would, in my friend's opinion, 'either come
so small as to be unmonumental, or so large as to
dwarf the statue into a doll.'</p>

<p>It will be seen from the principles enunciated in
the present work that the answers to the foregoing
questions were obviously as follows:</p>

<p>I. That the sculptor might use the arms alone
if he thought fit, and he might vary the shape
and size of the shield according to his fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>II. That he could omit the crest if he wished,
but if he elected to use it, the crest ought certainly
to be set upon a helm, which should face the same
way as the crest; the crested helm might also
be flourished about with such mantling as the
sculptor thought proper.</p>

<p>III. That in the particular drawing none of the
trophies was heraldic. The sculptor accordingly
could omit the whole, if he were so minded, or
could dispose about the arms and crested helm any
such other trophies of like character as would in his
judgment look well or be appropriate.</p>

<p>In a further letter my friend enumerates other
difficulties that vex poor artists. Must a shield
always be surmounted by a crested helm? Should
the helm face any special way according to the degree
of the bearer thereof? What are the ordinary
relative proportions which helm and crest should
bear to the shield? May a shield be set aslant as
well as upright? Should a torse be drawn with a
curved or a straight line? Is it necessary to represent
the engraved dots and lines indicative of the
tinctures? What are supporters to stand upon?
Are they to plant their feet on a ribbon or scroll, or
on a flowering mound, or what? May arms
entitled to have supporters be represented without
them? What are the simplest elements to which
a shield of arms may be reduced?&mdash;as, for example,
in a panel some 60 or 70 feet above the eye, and
when but a small space is available.</p>

<p>To a craftsman or designer who has grasped the
principles of heraldry these further questions will
present no difficulty, and most of them can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
answered by that appeal to medieval usage which
the nature of the illustrations renders possible.</p>

<p>These illustrations, it will be seen, are largely
selected from heraldic seals, and for the particular
reason that seals illustrate so admirably and in a
small compass such a number of those usages to
which appeal may confidently be made. Examples
of heraldry in conjunction with buildings, monuments,
and architectural features generally, have also
been given, and its application to the minor arts has
not been overlooked.</p>

<p>In order, too, to enable full advantage to be
taken of the long period covered by the illustrations,
the most typical of these have been collected into a
<a href="#CHRONOLOGICAL_SERIES_OF">chronological series at the end of the book</a>. It is
thus possible to show the gradual rise and decline of
heraldic art from the thirteenth to the seventeenth
century, beyond which it is hardly necessary to go.</p>

<p>The only modern illustrations that have been
tolerated are those showing the formation of the
Union Jack, and the degraded condition of the
so-called Royal Standard. The coloured frontispiece
is an attempt to show a more effective way of
displaying with equal heraldic 'correctness' the
arms of our Sovereign Lord King George the
Fifth.</p>

<small>INTRODUCTION</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Defects of Modern Heraldic Decoration; Appeal
to First Principles; English <i>versus</i> Foreign
Sources; Definition of Heraldry; Modes of
Display; Colours and Furs; Formation of Arms;
Divisions of the Shield; Early Authorities:
Seals, Monuments, Buildings, Wills and Inventories,
Rolls of Arms.</p></div>


<p>To those who have given attention to the
study of ancient heraldry few things are
more surprising than the imperfect understanding
of its true principles displayed in
their works by so many artists and craftsmen
of every degree. Year after year, in
paintings and sculpture at the Royal
Academy and other exhibitions, in the
architecture and decorations of our
churches and public buildings, on monuments,
on plate, jewellery, and ornaments
of all kinds, the attempt to introduce
armorial accessories, even by some of our
best artists, is almost always a failure.</p>

<p>In so recent a work as the national
memorial to Queen Victoria before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Buckingham Palace, the shields for Scotland
in the frieze of the pedestal bear the rampant
lion only, and the distinctive double
tressure is again omitted in the Scottish
quarter of the royal arms behind the figure
of Victory. The sides of the pedestal also
bear fanciful shields of arms, in the one case
with three lamps, in the other with some
allegorical device, charged on bends sinister!</p>

<p>It is only fair to say that the fault
appears to be not altogether that of the
artist or craftsman, but should rather be
ascribed to the disregard of the principles
and usages of true armory that pervades
so much of the printed literature to which
men naturally turn for information.</p>

<p>He, however, who would know something
about heraldic art must go behind
the books to better sources of information,
and rid himself once and for all of the
modern cast-iron rules that cramp all
attempts to improve matters. He will
then soon find himself revelling in the
delightful freedom and playful common-sense
of medieval armory when it was still
a living art, and a science too, utilized for
artistic purposes by every class of worker
and unencumbered by the ridiculous conceits
of Tudor and later times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>The appeal, moreover, should largely be
confined, if one would have what is best,
to our own land. In the beginning
heraldry was much the same in most
European countries, but in course of time
foreign armory became complicated by
needless subdivisions and new methods of
expression and combination. It would
indeed be foolish to maintain that nothing
can be learnt from foreign sources, but in
the earlier stages of study English heraldry
should come first. Not only is it characterized
by a beautiful simplicity which
continued practically unchanged until the
beginning of the sixteenth century, but no
other country outside England possesses
such a wealth of examples of its various
applications, and they lie immediately to
hand for purposes of study and comparison.
Moreover, English heraldry so fully illustrates
the general principles followed in
other countries that it is unnecessary at
first to go further afield.</p>

<p>Heraldry, or armory as it was anciently
called, is a symbolical and pictorial language
of uncertain and disputed origin, which,
by the beginning of the thirteenth century,
had already been reduced to a science with
a system, classification, and nomenclature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of its own. The artistic devices known as
arms, which may be formed by proper combinations
of the colours, ordinaries, and
figures that represent the letters of this
language, had each their significance, and
soon came to be regarded as the hereditary
possession of some person, family, dignity,
or office.</p>

</div>

<p>The display of arms was restricted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
primarily to shields and banners, but occasionally
to horse-trappers (pls. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XI">XI</a> B</span> and
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XII">XII</a> B</span>) and such garments as jupes, gowns,
and mantles. Later on heraldry came also
to be used ornamentally, either upon shields
or without them, in all kinds of ways, in
architecture and on monuments, on tiles
and in glazing, in woodcarvings and in
paintings, in woven stuffs and embroideries,
in jewellery and on seals.</p>

<p>The colours used in heraldry are red,
blue, green, purple, and black, or, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
give them their old names, gules, azure,
vert, purpure, and sable; combined with
the yellow of gold and the whiteness
of silver. Orange was never used, probably
on account of the difficulty of finding
a stable pigment. It was soon found that
for brilliancy of effect the use of gold or
silver with a colour was preferable to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of colour with colour or metal with metal;
two colours are therefore found together
or superposed only under certain conditions,
and the same applies to the two
metals.</p>

<p>Imitations of two furs, ermine and vair,
were also used: the one of white flecked
with little black tails; the other of alternating
oblong patches of white and blue,
square at the top and rounded at the
bottom, to represent grey squirrels' skins.
(See figs. <a href="#Fig_151">151</a>, <a href="#Fig_152">152</a>.) If vair were
coloured other than white and blue, the
resultant was called vairy. There is also
known a black fur with silver ermine-tails.</p>

<p>There were never any exact rules as to
the particular tint of the colour employed,
that being simply a matter of taste. Thus
blue may range from a full indigo almost
to Cambridge-blue, and red from a bright
scarlet, through vermilion, to a dull
brick colour, and so on; and it is surprising
to find how well quiet colours blend
together.</p>

<p>In the formation of arms the mere combinations
of colours and metals produced
by vertical, horizontal, or other divisions
of the shield were soon exhausted, as were
quarters, checkers, etc. There accordingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
grew quite naturally the further use of
applied strips or bands based upon such
divisions.</p>

<p>Thus the vertical parting of a metal and
a colour known as party produced the pale,
and a horizontal division the fesse or bar,
and these combined to form the cross suggested
by the quarterly lines. An oblique or
slanting parting gave rise to the bend, and
the crossing of two such produced the St.
Andrew's cross or saltire. A combination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of the lines of a saltire with a quarterly
division produced the varied field called
gyronny. The border almost suggested
itself. A cutting off of the upper half or
head of the shield yielded the chief, and of
a fourth part the quarter. One other of
these applied pieces, or ordinaries as they
were called, was the cheveron, formed of
two strips issuing from the lower edges of
the shield and meeting in a point in the
middle, like the cheverons forming the roof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
timbers of a house. Another ordinary
was the pile, which was often threefold
with lines converging towards the base as
in fig. <a href="#Fig_72">72</a>. Sometimes a shield was charged
with one of smaller size called a scutcheon,
and the middle of this was occasionally cut
out to form a voided scutcheon or orle.
Flanches, as they are called, are very rarely
found; they are formed by drawing incurving
lines within each side of the shield.
An even series of pales yielded a vertical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
striping called paly, and of piles, pily, while
an even number of bars became barry.
Undulated or waved bars formed wavy, and
sometimes paly and pily stripes were also
waved (fig. <a href="#Fig_19">19</a>). In early examples the
bend was often bended or curved. Bends
are so represented in one of the shields in
Westminster abbey (fig. <a href="#Fig_4">4</a>), in some of the
shields over the nave arcades in York
minster, and on a number of monumental
effigies. A narrower bend which overlaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
everything was known as a baston (see fig.
<a href="#Fig_60">60</a>). A number of narrow bends produced
bendy, but the lines were then straight.
A field divided into squares or checkers
formed checky, and when divided into what
are now called lozenges it became lozengy.
Pales, fesses, crosses, saltires, borders, and
cheverons sometimes had their edges engrailed
by taking out of them, as it were,
a continuous series of bites separated
by sharp points, and the lower edge of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
chief or the inner margin of a border was
often indented like the edge of a saw; but
in early heraldry engrailing and indenting
were interchangeable terms. An indented
fesse was anciently called a daunce. Cheverons,
fesses, bars, etc. were occasionally
battled, through the upper line being
formed into battlements. A fesse was
often placed between two cheverons, as in
the well-known arms of FitzWalter; or
between two very narrow bars called
cotises, or pairs of cotises called gemell
bars. Cheverons, bends, and pales were
also sometimes cotised. Cotises were
often of a tincture different from that
of the ordinary which they accompanied,
and sometimes indented or dancetty as in
the arms of Clopton (fig. <a href="#Fig_5">5</a>) and Gonvile.
The ground or field could be relieved by
the use of vair or ermine, or by the addition
of fretting or trellis-work or other simple
means. It was also not unfrequently
powdered with small crosses, fleurs-de-lis,
or billets; often in conjunction with a larger
charge like a cinqfoil or a lion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Almost from the beginning every kind
of device was charged or painted upon
shields, either singly or in multiple, and
upon or about such ordinaries as crosses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
cheverons, and fesses. Birds, beasts, and
fishes, and parts of them like heads, or
feet, or wings; flowers, fruits, and leaves;
suns, moons or crescents, and stars; fleurs-de-lis,
crosses, billets, roundels, rings, etc.&mdash;all
were pressed into the service. The
great rule as to colour held good as regards
charges, and it was not permissible to paint
a red rose upon blue or a gold star upon
silver; but a red rose upon gold or a silver
star upon blue was quite right.</p>

<p>It has however been lawful at all times
to place an ordinary, such as a fesse or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
cheveron, and whether charged or not,
upon a parti-coloured field like quarterly,
checky, paly, or barry, or upon vair or
vairy. A quarter, or a chief, or a border,
without reference to its colour, can also be
added to any such field.</p>

<p>Conversely, a parti-coloured cross, fesse,
or charge of any kind is allowable upon a
plain field.</p>

<p>In the Great Roll of arms, <i>temp</i>. Edward
II, are instances of two shields, in the one
case of a red lion, and in the other of
a red <i>fer-de-moline</i>, on fields party gold
and vert; also of a silver leopard upon
a field party gold and gules, and of three
red lions upon party gold and azure. Likewise
of a shield with three lions ermine
upon party azure and gules, and of another
with wavy red bars upon a field party
gold and silver.</p>

<p>In the arms, too, of Eton College
granted by King Henry VI in 1448-9
three silver lilies on a black field are combined
with a chief party azure and gules,
with a gold leopard on the red half and a
gold fleur-de-lis on the blue half. King
Henry also granted in 1449 these arms,
<i>party cheveronwise gules and sable three gold
keys</i>, to Roger Keys, clerk, for his services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
in connexion with the building of Eton
College, and to his brother Thomas Keys
and his descendants.</p>

<p>Shields with quarterly fields often had a
single charge in the quarter, like the well-known
molet of the Veres, or the eagle of
Phelip.</p>

<p>Arms were sometimes counter-coloured,
by interchanging the tinctures of the whole
or parts of an ordinary or charge or charges
overlying a parti-coloured field. This often
has a very striking effect, as in the arms of
St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which are <i>party
silver and sable a cheveron counter-coloured</i>, or
those of Geoffrey Chaucer, who bore <i>party
silver and gules a bend counter-coloured</i>. Sir
Robert Farnham bore <i>quarterly silver and
azure four crescents counter-coloured</i>, or, as the
Great Roll describes them, 'de l'un en
l'autre.' The town of Southampton likewise
bears for its arms <i>gules a chief silver
with three roses counter-coloured</i>.</p>

<p>In drawing parti-coloured fields it is as
well to consider what are the old rules with
regard to them. In the early rolls a field
barry of silver and azure, or of gold and
sable, is often described as of six pieces,
that is, with three coloured bars alternating
with three of the metal, though barry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
of eight and even ten pieces is found.
Paly of six pieces is also a normal
number. But the number of pieces
must always be even, or the alternate
pieces will become bars or pales. The
number of squares in each line of a
checkered field or ordinary is also another
important matter. Six or eight form the
usual basis for the division of a field, but
the seven on the seal of the earl of
Warenne and Surrey attached to the Barons'
Letter of 1300-1 is not without its artistic
advantages. On an ordinary, such as a fesse
or cross, there should be at least two rows
of checkers. Here, however, as in other
cases, much depends upon the size of the
shield, and a large one could obviously
carry with advantage either on field or
ordinary more squares than a small one
without infringing any heraldic law.</p>

<p>Besides the plain cross familiar to most
of us in the arms of St. George, and the
similar form with engrailed edges, there is
a variety known as the ragged cross, derived
from two crossed pieces of a tree with
lopped branches. This is often used in
the so-called arms of Our Lord, showing
the instruments of His Passion, or in compositions
associated therewith, as in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
cross with the three crowned nails forming
the arms of the town of Colchester.</p>

<p>Several other forms of cross have also
been used. The most popular of these
is that with splayed or spreading ends,
often split into three divisions, called the
cross paty, which appears in the arms of
St. Edward (see figs. <a href="#Fig_2">2</a> and <a href="#Fig_43">43</a>). It is
practically the same as the cross called
patonce, flory, or fleury, these being names
applied to mere variations of drawing. The
cross with <i>les chefs flurettes</i> of the Great
Roll seems to have been one flowered, or
with fleurs-de-lis, at the ends.</p>

<p>Another favourite cross was that with
forked or split ends, formed of a <i>fer-de-moline</i>
or mill-rind, sometimes called a
cross <i>fourchée</i>, or, when the split ends were
coiled, a cross <i>recercelée</i>. The arms of
Antony Bek bishop of Durham (1284-1310)
and patriarch of Jerusalem were
<i>gules a fer-de-moline ermine</i>, and certain
vestments 'woven with a cross of his arms
which are called <i>ferrum molendini</i>' passed
to his cathedral church at his death. On
his seal of dignity the bishop is shown
actually wearing such a vestment of his arms.</p>

<p>The tau or St. Anthony's cross also
occurs in some late fifteenth century arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The small crosses with which the field
of a shield was sometimes powdered were
usually what are now called crosslets, but
with rounded instead of the modern squared
angles, as in the Beauchamp arms (fig. <a href="#Fig_14">14</a>),
and a field powdered with these was simply
called crusily. But the powdering sometimes
consisted of crosses paty, or formy
as they were also styled, as in the arms of
Berkeley, or of the cross with crutched
ends called a cross potent, like that in the
arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. These
crosses often had a spiked foot, as if for
fixing them in the ground, and were then
further described as fitchy or crosses
fixable.</p>

<p>Since the elucidation of the artistic rather
than the scientific side of heraldry is the
object of this present work, it is advisable
to show how it may best be studied.</p>

<p>The artistic treatment of heraldry can
only be taught imperfectly by means of
books, and it is far better that the student
should be his own teacher by consulting
such good examples of heraldic art as may
commonly be found nigh at hand. He
may, however, first equip himself to advantage
with a proper grasp of the subject
by reading carefully the admirable article<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
on Heraldry, by Mr. Oswald Barron, in the
new (eleventh) edition of the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>.</p>

<p>The earliest and best of artistic authorities
are heraldic seals. These came into common
use towards the end of the twelfth century,
much at the same time that armory itself
became a thing of life, and they were constantly
being engraved for men, and even
for women, who bore and used arms, and
for corporate bodies entitled to have seals.</p>

<p>Moreover, since every seal was produced
under the direction of its owner and
continually used by him, the heraldry displayed
on seals has a personal interest of
the greatest value, as showing not only
what arms the owner bore, but how they
were intended to be seen.</p>

<p>From seals may be learnt the different
shapes of shields, and the times of their
changes of fashion; the methods of depicting
crests; the origin and use of supporters;
the treatment of the 'words' and
'reasons' now called mottoes; the various
ways of combining arms to indicate alliances,
kinships, and official connexions; and the
many other effective ways in which heraldry
may be treated artistically without breaking
the rigid rules of its scientific side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Seals, unfortunately, owing to their inaccessibility,
are not so generally available
for purposes of study as some other
authorities. They are consequently comparatively
little known. Fine series, both
of original impressions and casts, are on
exhibition in the British and the Victoria
and Albert Museums, and in not a few
local museums also,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but the great collection
in the British Museum is practically the
only public one that can be utilized to any
extent by the heraldic student, and then
under the limitation of applying for each
seal by a separate ticket.</p>

<p>The many examples of armorial seals
illustrated in the present work will give
the student a good idea of their importance
and high artistic excellence.</p>

<p>Next to the heraldry on seals, that displayed
on tombs and monuments, and in
combination with architecture, may be
studied, and, of course, with greater ease,
since such a number of examples is available.
Many a village church is comparatively
as rich in heraldry as the abbey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
churches of Westminster and St. Albans,
or the minsters of Lincoln and York and
Beverley.</p>

<p>It is to the country church, too, that we
may often look for lovely examples of old
heraldic glass, which has escaped the destruction
of other subjects that were deemed
more superstitious (pls. <span class="smcap">I</span>, <span class="smcap">II</span>, and <span class="smcap">III</span>).</p>

<p>But the student is not restricted to
ecclesiastical buildings in his search for
good examples of heraldry.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as there never was such a
thing as an ecclesiastical style, it was quite
immaterial to the medieval master masons
whether they were called in to build a
church or a gatehouse, a castle or a mansion,
a barn or a bridge. The master carpenter
worked in the same way upon a rood loft or
a pew end as upon the screen or the coffer
in the house of the lord; the glazier filled
alike with his coloured transparencies the
bay of the hall, the window of the chapel,
or that of the minster or the abbey; and
the tiler sold his wares to sacrist, churchwarden,
or squire alike.</p>

<p>The applications of heraldry to architecture
are so numerous that it is not easy to
deal with them in any degree of connexion.</p>

<p>Shields of arms, badges, crests, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
supporters are freely used in every conceivable
way, and on every reasonable place:
on gatehouses (figs. <a href="#Fig_3">3</a>, <a href="#Fig_95">95</a>, <a href="#Fig_96">96</a>) and towers,
on porches and doorways, in windows and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
on walls, on plinths, buttresses, and pinnacles,

kinds, on tombs, fonts, pulpits, screens, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a><br /><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a><br /><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>

<p>Though actual examples are now rare,
we know from pictures and monuments,
and the tantalizing descriptions in inventories,
to how large an extent heraldry
was used in embroidery and woven work,
on carpets and hangings, on copes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
frontals, on gowns, mantles, and jupes, on
trappers and in banners, and even on the

</div>

<p>Wills and inventories also tell us that in
jewellery and goldsmiths' work (see figs.
<a href="#Fig_11">11</a> and <a href="#Fig_12">12</a>) heraldry played a prominent
part, and by the aid of enamel it
appeared in its proper colours, an ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>vantage
not always attainable otherwise
(fig. <a href="#Fig_13">13</a>). Beautiful examples of heraldic
shields bright with enamel occur in the
abbey church of Westminster on the tombs
of King Edward III and of William of
Valence, and on the tombs at Canterbury
and Warwick respectively of Edward
prince of Wales and Richard Beauchamp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
earl of Warwick; while in St. George's
chapel in Windsor castle there are actually
nearly ninety enamelled stall-plates of
Knights of the Garter of earlier date than
Tudor times, extending from about 1390
to 1485, and forming in themselves a veritable
heraldic storehouse of the highest
artistic excellence. (See pls. <span class="smcap">XV</span>, <span class="smcap">XVI</span>.)</p>

<p>Another source of coloured heraldry is to
be found in the so-called rolls of arms.</p>

<p>While heraldry was a living art, it
obviously became necessary to keep some
record of the numerous armorial bearings
which were already in use, as well as of those
that were constantly being invented. This
seems to have been done by entering the
arms on long rolls of parchment. In the
earliest examples these took the form of
rows of painted shields, with the owners'
names written over (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_IV">IV</a></span>); but in
a few rare cases the blazon or written
description of the arms is also given, while
other rolls consist wholly of such descriptions,
as in the well-known Great and
Boroughbridge Rolls. These have a special
value in supplying the terminology of
the old heraldry, but this belongs to the
science or grammar and not the art of it.
The pictured rolls, on the other hand, clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
belong to the artistic side, and as they date
from the middle of the thirteenth century
onwards, they show how the early heralds
from time to time drew the arms they
wished to record.</p>

<small>THE SHIELD AND ITS TREATMENT</small></h2>

a Shield; Apparent <i>versus</i> Absolute Uniformity;

and Abuse of Quartering: its Origin and
Growth; Differencing of Arms; The Scutcheon

<p>From these preliminary remarks we may
pass to the practical consideration of the
principles of heraldic art.</p>

<p>And first as to shields and their treatment.</p>

<p>The form of a shield is in itself entirely
arbitrary and void of meaning. Although it
varied from time to time, this was simply a
matter of fashion, like the shape of an arch
or the pattern of a window. Such changes
must not, however, be overlooked, for it
would be absurd in actual practice to use
an ornate shield of the style of the fifteenth
or sixteenth century for a lion of (say) the
thirteenth century type, or to fill a shield
of early form with charges characteristic of
a later date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>During the twelfth century shields were
more or less kite-shaped, like those that
were actually used, but in the thirteenth
century they began to be shorter and
straighter across the top. Good examples
of this type may be found on seals. In the
aisles behind the quire of Westminster
abbey church, the beautiful shields in the
spandrels of the wall arcade, of a date not
later than 1259, retain their rounded upper
corners. (See figs. <a href="#Fig_2">2</a> and <a href="#Fig_15">15</a>.) The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
form, with the upper corners square
(figs. <a href="#Fig_16">16</a>, <a href="#Fig_17">17</a>), came into vogue in the
second half of the thirteenth century, and
has continued always in use. Owing to the
elastic way in which its curves can be
slightly altered when required, it may
safely be adopted in general practice. In
the earliest examples the curves begin at
the top, or just below, but later on they
were so struck as to increase the area<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of the lower part of the shield in order
to make more room for the charges. In
some fourteenth century instances the sides
continue straight nearly to the bottom, so
that the shield is practically an oblong with
rounded lower corners, like the shields of
the royal arms on our coinage to-day
(fig. <a href="#Fig_18">18</a> and pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_VI">VI</a> A</span>). A tendency in
the same direction is not uncommon
throughout the fifteenth century. About
the middle of the same century the
fashion began to prevail, alongside the other,
of representing a man's arms on the same
irregularly shaped shield that he was wont
to carry in the jousts. This is as wide at
the bottom as the top, with its outline
worked into curves, and has on the dexter,
or right-hand side as borne, a deep notch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
for the lance to rest in during tilting; the
top and bottom of the shield are often subdivided
into three or more lobes or shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
curves. Good examples occur on seals and
monuments, and some of the Garter stall-plates.
(See pls. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_V">V</a> A</span> and <span class="smcap">B</span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_VI">VI</a> B</span>; <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XVII">XVII</a></span>; and
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIII">XXIII</a> A</span>.) Shields of a more ornate form are
occasionally to be met with, like an example
(fig. <a href="#Fig_19">19</a>) on a brass at Stoke Poges of the
date 1476, with graceful leaf-work curling
over at the top and bottom. Shields
similarly ornamented occur on the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>way
of a citizen's house now built into the
Guildhall at Norwich (fig. <a href="#Fig_20">20</a>).</p>

<p>In the simpler forms the field of a shield
in painted representations is invariably
shown flat; but in carvings, and occasionally
on seals, a slight convexity, or even
concavity, is often met with, the artistic
advantages of which it is unnecessary to
enlarge upon. In some of the later ornate
forms, like those described above, the
incurved or engrailed edge is accompanied
by a field worked with a series of ridges
and furrows (figs. <a href="#Fig_21">21</a> and <a href="#Fig_23">23</a>). The
effect of this may be good, but there is a
danger of carrying it to excess and so injuring
the appearance of the charges. If
the shield be well covered by the bearings
on it, it is generally better to use one of
simple form than one with an irregular
outline and ridged surface; but there is,
of course, no reason why both forms should
not be used concurrently in architectural or
other works, as they sometimes were of old.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_21"></a>

Ramryge in St. Albans abbey church.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The same principle as the ridging of a
shield to relieve the plain surface was also
applied to the ordinaries upon it. An early
example may be seen upon the tomb of
queen Eleanor at Westminster, which has
the bends in the shields of Ponthieu ridged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a><br /><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
along the middle line. The shield borne
by Brian FitzAlan (<i>ob.</i> 1302) in his effigy
at Bedale has the alternate bars of his arms
(<i>barry of eight pieces gold and gules</i>) treated
in the same way. Another instance may
be seen on the effigy of Sir Richard
Whatton (<i>c.</i> 1325) at Whatton, Notts, in
which a bend, though charged, is ridged.
The shields on the tomb of Guy lord
Bryen (<i>ob.</i> 1390) at Tewkesbury (fig. <a href="#Fig_22">22</a>)
furnish typical later examples, while during
the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries
instances are as common as the curved and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
ridged shields described above, especially as
regards crosses and saltires, as at St. Albans,
the George Inn at Glastonbury (fig. <a href="#Fig_23">23</a>),
and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In monumental effigies the shield borne
by a knight often has a convex or rounded
surface (fig. <a href="#Fig_24">24</a>), and in late fifteenth
century and Tudor architecture otherwise
flat shields sometimes have the middle
swelled out, as on dean Gunthorpe's oriel
at Wells, in a manner very popular in
Renaissance work. (See figs. <a href="#Fig_111">111</a> and <a href="#Fig_195">195</a>.)</p>

<p>A reference to a number of good ancient
examples of heraldic shields or banners will
disclose the care that has been taken to
occupy the field, as far as possible, with
whatever is placed upon it (figs. <a href="#Fig_25">25</a>, <a href="#Fig_26">26</a>,
<a href="#Fig_27">27</a>). A lion or an eagle, for instance, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a><br /><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
have the limbs and extremities so spread
out as to fill every available space; and
the same will be found in every group or
combination of objects capable of arrangement
or extension.</p>

<p>Even with most unpromising combinations,

</div>

<p>Another point that may be noticed in
all old work is that in shields containing
several similar objects no two are exactly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
alike. If the charges be, for example,
three roses or three roundels or three
lions (fig. <a href="#Fig_32">32</a>), two will be placed in the
upper and the third in the lower part of
the shield. But the latter will often be
somewhat larger than the others, and these,
in turn, will differ slightly the one from
the other as they do in nature. So, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
in a case like the three leopards of the King
of England, whether displayed on shield or
in banner, no two are exactly alike, but
each differs somewhat from another in
pose or in size (fig. <a href="#Fig_32">32</a>). Even when
the same charge is repeated many times,
like the fleurs-de-lis in the old arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of France, any possible chance of mechanical
monotony is avoided by a trifling
variation in the shape of each, as in the
shield of the King of France in the early
series at Westminster (fig. <a href="#Fig_34">34</a>).</p>

<p>Another fact is that in the old work
lines and curves are hardly ever quite true,
but drawn by hand instead of with pen or
compasses. The modern artist, on the
contrary, usually draws his lines and curves
with mechanical precision; his charges are
exact copies one of another; the fact that
they do not fill the field (<i>pace</i> the royal
arms on the coinage) is to him quite unimportant,
and the final result is that under
no circumstances will his work look well.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Even in old stencilling a pleasing effect
never seen in modern work of the kind was
produced through a not too rigid adherence
to a regularity of application.</p>

<p>Another cause of the bad effect of much
modern heraldry is the unnecessary adherence

textbooks and manuals as to the relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
widths of ordinaries and subordinaries.

a bend, a fesse, or a cross was drawn of the
best proportion to look well (figs. <a href="#Fig_35">35</a>, <a href="#Fig_36">36</a>).
If charged it would be wider than when
plain. If placed between charges it was
drawn narrower, if itself uncharged, and
thus took its proper relative position with
regard to the size and arrangement or
the charges. So, too, with a border; if
uncharged or merely gobony (<i>i.e.</i> formed
of short lengths of alternate colours) or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a><br /><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
engrailed, it was drawn very narrow, and
even if charged it was not allowed much
greater width (figs. <a href="#Fig_38">38</a>, <a href="#Fig_39">39</a>). It thus
never unduly encroached upon the field or
other contents of the shield, and yet remained
an artistic addition in itself. The
curious bordering known as the tressure,
which is almost peculiar to Scotland, and
familiar to us through its occurrence in the
shield of our Sovereign, is drawn sufficiently
narrow in all good examples to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
ample room for the ramping lion it fences
in, and its frieze of fleurs-de-lis is formed of
a good number of flowers, instead of the
eight considered sufficient in the royal arms
of to-day. Even a chief, if necessary, was
enlarged from the 'less than one-third of
the shield' of to-day to the one-half of it,
or even more, as may be seen in some of
the examples of the arms of the monastery
in the abbey church of Westminster, or in
those of the town of Southampton.</p>

</div>

<p>Another feature of early heraldry which
it is well to bear in mind is the sparing use
of what is known as quartering, or the
method of combining in one shield the arms
of two or more persons or families. One
of our oldest instances of this occurs on the
tomb of Queen Eleanor, the first wife of
King Edward I, at Westminster, and shows
her paternal arms of Castile and Leon so
arranged (fig. <a href="#Fig_40">40</a>). Another early example
occurs in the Great Roll, <i>temp.</i> Edward II,
where the arms of Sir Simon Montagu (<i>ob. c.
1316</i>), <i>silver a fesse indented gules of three indentures</i>,
are quartered with <i>azure a gold griffin</i>.
So long as the shield contained only four
quarters, with the first and fourth, and
the second and third, respectively alike,
the effect was often good, as in the cases just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a><br /><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
noted, or in the beautiful arms of France and
England combined used after 1340 by King
Edward III (fig. <a href="#Fig_41">41</a>). There are also many
examples, as in the well-known bearings of
the Veres and of the Despensers, where
a quarterly disposition of the shield forms
the basis of the arms. But when, as became
common in the fifteenth century, quarters
were multiplied or subdivided, the artistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
effect of the old simple shield was lost or
destroyed. As the principle was further
extended, especially in Tudor and Stewart
times, the result became more and more
confused in appearance, until the field
resembled rather a piece of coloured patchwork
than a combination of various arms
all more or less beautiful in themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>The origin and growth of these combinations,
which actually are perfectly lawful
and proper, and yet often quite accidental,
can easily be illustrated by a few typical
examples.</p>

<p>In 1382 King Richard II, who used the
same arms as his grandfather, a quarterly
shield of Old France and England, married
Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the Emperor
Charles IV. As her shield was also a
quartered one, the combined arms of the
king and his queen, as shown upon her
seal, formed a shield of eight quarters
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_VII">VII</a> A</span>). This was further complicated
through the later assumption by King
Richard of the arms assigned to St.
Edward (fig. <a href="#Fig_43">43</a>), a cross between five
birds; and the eight-quartered shield with
this clumsy addition at one side may be
seen on the Felbrigge brass.</p>

</div>

<p>These arms of St. Edward were used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a><br /><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
a time duly 'differenced' in conjunction
with his own quarterly arms by Henry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
Lancaster, afterwards King Henry IV, and
are impaled with those of his wife, Mary de
Bohun, on his seal (1399) as duke of
Hereford. Artistically the lop-sided effect
so produced is quite unhappy.</p>

<p>Many fifteenth century shields show
forth, by the simple quartering of a man's
arms with those of his wife or his mother,
his succession or summons as a lord of
parliament, or his inheritance of great
estates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>But this simplicity was gradually destroyed
when the added quartering was
itself quartered, as in the arms of Richard
Nevill earl of Salisbury (see pls. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XVII">XVII</a> A</span> and
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXII">XXII</a> B</span>), or the quarterings were all different,
as in the case of Humphrey Stafford duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of Buckingham. When but a year old he
succeeded his father as earl of Stafford,
and on his mother's death he became earl
of Buckingham, Hereford, Northampton,
Essex, and Perche! These dignities are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a><br /><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
duly displayed in the quarterings of his arms
on his seal, as follows: 1. The quartered arms
of his mother, for the earldom of Buckingham.
2. Bohun of Hereford. 3. Bohun of
Northampton. 4. Stafford (fig. <a href="#Fig_44">44</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_44"></a>

</div>

<p>When Henry duke of Buckingham
succeeded in 1460 to all the dignities of
duke Humphrey his grandfather, he wisely
elected, by the advice of the kings-of-arms,
to drop the above quarterings, and to use
only the arms of his great-grandmother,
who as sister and heir of Humphrey duke
of Gloucester and earl of Buckingham
bore <i>France and England quarterly within a
border silver</i>.</p>

<p>About 1433 Margaret, daughter of
Richard Beauchamp earl of Warwick, was
married to John Talbot earl of Shrewsbury,
and she thereupon had a beautiful
seal engraved, with two large shields or
arms hung side by side by their straps
from a ragged staff, the badge of her
father's house (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXVII">XXVII</a> B</span>). This charming
composition is, however, quite spoilt
through the complicated treatment of the
shields. One of these bears the arms of
husband and wife conjoined, the other
those of the lady's father. The earl of
Warwick's shield is a quartered one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Beauchamp and Newburgh, with a small
superimposed scutcheon. The earl of
Shrewsbury's arms also consisted of four
quarters, to which his wife added her four
(omitting the scutcheon), and thus made a
patchwork of eight.</p>

<p>A more remarkable and equally accidental
case may be illustrated by the brass of Sir
Humphrey Bourchier (1471) in the abbey
church of Westminster.</p>

<p>This displays four shields: one has the
arms of Bourchier quartering Lovain and
impaling the quarterly arms of Berners;
and another, the six quarterings of Sir
Humphrey's wife, Elizabeth Tylney. In
a third shield these are quite properly
impaled, with a resultant of fourteen
quarters. In the fourth shield these are
quartered together, and so produce a
dreadful confusion of twenty-eight quarters!
It is not necessary here to show how
these shields might have been simplified in
themselves, but from the artistic standpoint
there cannot be any doubt that the two first
should at least have been kept separate.
The many other examples to be found in
the illustrations of this book will serve as
useful reminders of the greater advantage
artistically of simpler treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>It is moreover well to remember that in
the majority of cases there is not the least
need in actual work to produce a great
many quarterings in a shield. In numerous
examples, especially in the sixteenth century
and later, they were assumed merely for
display, and to reduce them to a reasonable
few is often a most desirable thing.</p>

<p>It is difficult without knowledge of
individual cases to lay down any definite
rules for dealing with quarterings, but
there can be no question that in general
a shield looks best without any at all. In
the case of a man with a compound name
or title, who represents more than one
family or dignity, it would be legitimate
to add a quartering on that account, but
only of the actual arms of the family or
dignity represented. It is however so
hard to draw a line or to restrain the
wishes of clients that the fifteenth century
example of Henry duke of Buckingham
should ever be borne in mind.</p>

<p>As soon as the principle of hereditary
descent of armorial bearings became established,
the necessity arose of making some
slight difference between the arms of a
father and those borne by his sons. This
was usually done by adding to the paternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
arms such more or less unobtrusive device
as a label, or narrow border, or a small
charge like a crescent or a molet.</p>

<p>The lord John of Eltham, son of King
Edward II, bears upon his tomb at Westminster
a beautifully carved shield of the
arms of England differenced by a border
of France; and one of the sons of King
Edward III, Thomas of Woodstock,
differenced his father's arms by a silver
border, as at an earlier period did Edmund
earl of Kent, the youngest son of King
Edward I.</p>

<p>The label is a narrow band with long
pendent strips or pieces, usually three,
but sometimes four or five in number,
placed upon and across the upper part
of a shield (fig. <a href="#Fig_45">45</a>). It is now used
to distinguish the arms of an eldest son
from those of his father, but this was
not always the rule, and younger sons of
King Henry III and King Edward I, and
at least three of the sons of King Edward
III, besides the Prince of Wales, bore distinctive
labels for difference. Anciently,
the label was very narrow, and the pendent
pieces of equal or nearly equal width
throughout, even when charged with devices,
as they sometimes were. The colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
was also a matter of choice. The first
three Edwards, during their fathers' lifetime,
successively bore blue labels, sometimes
of three, sometimes of five pieces,
while the younger brother of King Edward
I, Edmund earl of Lancaster, used a label
of France (blue with gold fleurs-de-lis)
of four pieces, and Thomas of Brotherton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
second son of King Edward I, a silver label
of three pieces.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_45"></a>

the Elsing brass (1347), with diapered

</div>

<p>In the case of the sons of King Edward
III, the Prince of Wales bore at first a
silver label of five and later of three pieces;
Lionel duke of Clarence seems to have
borne at one time a gold label with a red
cross on each piece for Ulster, and at
another a silver label charged on each piece
with a red quarter for Clare; John of
Gaunt duke of Lancaster bore an ermine
label for his earldom of Richmond (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_II">II</a></span>);
and Edmund duke of York a silver label
with three red roundels on each piece
(pl.<span class="smcap"> <a href="#PLATE_XXI">XXI</a> B</span>). The rolls of arms furnish
instances of labels of all colours, and with
pieces charged with various devices, such
as leopards, eagles, castles, martlets, etc.</p>

<p>Differencing with labels was likewise
extended to crests, and a good example
may be seen on the monument of Edward
prince of Wales (<i>ob.</i> 1376) at Canterbury
(fig. <a href="#Fig_46">46</a>), as well as in fig. <a href="#Fig_139">139</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_46"></a>

Edward prince of Wales at Canterbury,

</div>

<p>In modern heraldry the label is often
drawn unduly wide, with short and ugly
wedge-shaped pieces hanging from or
sticking on to it, and sometimes it does not
even extend to the sides of the shield.
The result is that instead of its being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
comparatively unobtrusive addition to the
arms the label becomes unduly conspicuous
and void of all artistic effect.</p>

<p>The old way of differencing by the addition
of a crescent, molet, or similar device<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
was generally carried out in quite an artistic
fashion on account of the care taken to
place the device agreeably, a favourite
position being on the principal ordinary or
charge of the arms.</p>

<p>Many cadets of the great family of
Nevill, for example, differenced the arms
of their house, <i>gules a saltire silver</i>, by
placing the device on the middle of the
saltire, and some of the Beauchamps placed
the differencing mark on the fesse of their
arms. In other cases the device was placed
in the upper part of the shield, or in some
other such point where it would least interfere
with or be confounded with the charges.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult differences an
artist has to contend with to-day is the silver
scutcheon with a red hand which is placed
upon the arms of baronets. Its position
of course varies, and may often be altered
with advantage, and it looks all the better
if drawn not unduly large and with a
simple heater-shaped shield. But some
artists wisely leave it out altogether.</p>

<p>In the case of all devices introduced as
differences it will generally be found advisable
to draw them to a somewhat
smaller scale than the charges already in
the arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a><br /><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>In many ancient heraldic shields, especially
in painted glass, and to a lesser
extent in carved work and on seals, the
plain uncharged surfaces of the field or
ordinaries are relieved by covering them
with the purely ornamental decoration
called diapering (figs. <a href="#Fig_45">45</a>, <a href="#Fig_48">48</a>). An
early instance in relief occurs on the
shield of the effigy in the Templars'
church in London usually ascribed to
Geoffrey de Magnavilla; and another
delicately sculptured example of later date<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
is to be seen on the Vere effigy in Hatfield
Broadoak church in Essex (fig. <a href="#Fig_47">47</a>).
Several fine instances of painted diapering
will be found in Stothard's <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span><i>Monumental
Effigies</i>. This beautiful treatment has,
happily, been largely revived of late years
by the glass painters, who use it quite
successfully, probably from the ease with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
which in their case it can be applied.
Modern carvers use it very sparingly, and
this perhaps is as it should be, for diapering
needs to be done with great skill in sculpture
to look well. A careful study therefore of old
examples is advisable, in order thoroughly to
understand the principles of its application.</p>

<p>It is of course to be borne in mind that
diapering is merely a surface decoration,
and it must not on any account be emphasized
by any difference of colour from that
of the field or ordinary it relieves, nor
must it be treated with such prominence
as to render it liable to be mistaken for a
charge or charges.</p>

<p>Diapering can be represented effectively
in embroidered work by the use of flowered
or patterned damasks, as may be seen in
the banners in St. Paul's cathedral church
in the chapel of the Order of St. Michael
and St. George.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the shield
a few words must be written about the
armorial bearings of ladies.</p>

<p>It has always been the practice for the
daughters of a house to bear, without
difference or alteration, the arms of their
father. This practice has been departed
from only in quite modern times, by the
addition of distinctive labels to the arms
borne by our princesses. To the manner
in which married ladies have arranged or
'marshalled' their arms reference will be
made later, but it is necessary here to call
attention to the fact that it has been
customary for a long time to place the
arms of widows and single ladies upon
shields that are lozenge-shaped. A good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
early example is that from the monument
in Westminster abbey church of Frances
Brandon duchess of Suffolk (<i>ob.</i> 1559),
shown in fig. <a href="#Fig_51">51</a>.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="caption-hanging"><span class="smcap">Fig. 51.</span> Lozenge of arms from the monument
at Westminster of Frances Brandon duchess
of Suffolk (<i>ob.</i> 1559).</p></div>
</div>

<p>This singularly inconvenient form of
shield, upon which it is often impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
to draw the arms properly, began to be
used early in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>It was not, however, used for or restricted
to the arms of ladies, since the
evidence of seals shows that it was at first
used to contain the armorial bearings of
men. There can likewise be little doubt
that it and the roundel, which was also
charged with arms, were contemporaneously
invented by the seal engravers as
variants from the ordinary form of shield;
and it is interesting to note that the
majority of the examples occur on seals
which have a background or setting of
elaborate tracery.</p>

<p>The roundel seems to have originated in
the covering of the entire field of a circular
seal with the arms of its owner, such as
the leopards of England which are so
disposed in a counterseal of Edward of
Carnarvon as prince of Wales. Two seals
of John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster,
engraved probably in 1372, show a similar
treatment: the one bearing his arms
impaling, and the other his arms impaled
with, those of Castile and Leon
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_VII">VII</a> B</span>). The former commemorates
his marriage with Constance of Castile,
and the latter the duke's claim in right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of his wife to the kingdom of Castile
itself.</p>

<p>A large enamelled roundel, <i>party gules and
azure with a gold charbocle</i>, accompanies
the shield and crested helm which, with it,
form the stall-plate of Ralph lord Bassett
(<i>c.</i> 1390) at Windsor.</p>

<p>One of the lesser seals appended to the
Barons' Letter, that of Robert FitzPain, is an
oval filled with the owner's arms (fig. <a href="#Fig_52">52</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>One of the earliest examples of arms on
a lozenge is on a seal of Thomas Furnival,
who died in 1279, and another but little
later is furnished by the seal of William
de Braose, appended to a deed of either
1282 or 1314 at Magdalen College, Oxford
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_IX">IX</a> B</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>That of William Paynel, appended to
the Barons' Letter, also has his arms on a
lozenge (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_IX">IX</a> A</span>).</p>

<p>The first seal of a lady in which lozenges
of arms occur is probably that of Joan,
daughter of Henry count of Barre and
Eleanor daughter of King Edward I, who
married, in 1306, John de Warenne earl of
Surrey (fig. <a href="#Fig_53">53</a>). This has five lozenges
arranged in cross: that in the middle has
her husband's checkers, those on each side
her father's barbels, etc. and those above
and below the three leopards of England.
The lady's descent from King Edward is
further shown by the castles and lions of his
consort Eleanor of Castile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 53.</span> Seal of Joan de Barre, wife of John de
Warenne earl of Surrey, 1306.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another interesting example, of a date
about 1320, is the seal of Parnel, daughter
of H. de Grapenell, and widow (1) of John
FitzJohn and (2) of Sir John Bensted (<i>ob.</i>
1323). This has in the middle a shield of
the arms of Bensted, <i>gules three gold gemell-bars</i>,
between four lozenges, apparently
for Grapenell and FitzJohn (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_IX">IX</a> C</span>).</p>

<p>Contemporary with Parnel Bensted's
seal are two others in which roundels are
used instead of lozenges. Both are traceried
seals of Elizabeth daughter of
Gilbert of Clare earl of Gloucester, and
Joan daughter of King Edward I and
Queen Eleanor of Castile. She was thrice
married: first, about 1306 to John of Burgh,
son of Richard earl of Ulster; secondly
to Theobald lord Verdon; and thirdly to
Roger lord d'Amory, who died in 1322.</p>

<p>One of these seals has in the middle, in
a shield, Elizabeth's own arms of Clare
impaling Burgh within a black border bedewed
with tears. Above and below are
roundels of Clare, and on either side other
roundels of Verdon and d'Amory. In the
interspaces are the castles and lions of
Castile and Leon (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_IX">IX</a> D</span>).</p>

<p>The other seal is similarly arranged, but
has in the middle a large shield of d'Amory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
between roundels of arms of the lady's
other husbands above and below, and of
Clare for her father or herself on either
side. The interspaces again contain castles
and lions (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_IX">IX</a> E</span>).</p>

<p>Four other early seals of great artistic
merit displaying roundels may also be
described, especially since they are apparently
the work of the same engraver.
They are filled with tracery, consisting of a
triangle enclosing a circle, which contains
a large shield, with cusped circles on its
sides containing roundels or devices.</p>

<p>The first is for Mary de Seynt-Pol, who
married in 1322 Aymer of Valence earl of
Pembroke (fig. <a href="#Fig_54">54</a>). The shield bears the
dimidiated arms of husband and wife; on a
roundel in base are the arms of her mother;
and higher up are roundels of England and
France, out of compliment to King Edward
II and Queen Isabel.</p>

</div>

<p>The second is for John de Bohun earl
of Hereford, and has a large shield of
Bohun with roundels also of Bohun. It
was probably engraved in 1322, and before
the earl's marriage in 1325 (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_X">X</a> A</span>).</p>

<p>The third is for Richard FitzAlan earl
of Arundel (1330-1), who succeeded to
the vast Warenne estates in 1347. It has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
in the middle a shield of FitzAlan, and
about it three roundels with the checkers
of Warenne.</p>

<p>The fourth is for Hugh Courtenay earl
of Devon (1334-5-40)or his son Hugh
(1340-77). The shield displays the arms
of Courtenay and in each of the outer
circles is a sexfoil (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_X">X</a> B</span>).</p>

<p>To these examples may be added a fifth
of about the same date, for Henry Sturmy
or Esturmy, lord of the forest of Savernake.
This has the Sturmy shield in the middle,
between two roundels of the Hussey arms,
and a third roundel above with the tenure
horn of Savernake Forest (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_X">X</a> C</span>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>Other seals that may be quoted in illustration
of the indiscriminate use of shields,
roundels, and lozenges during the fourteenth
century are those of: (1) Juliana,
daughter of Thomas Leybourne, and wife
of John lord Hastings (<i>ob.</i> 1325), with a
shield of Hastings impaling Leybourne,
encircled by six lozenges of arms indicative
of other alliances and descents, derived
from the fact of the lady having been
married thrice; (2) Elizabeth de Multon,
wife of Walter Bermyngham, with the
shield of Bermyngham surrounded by six
roundels of other arms; (3) Maud, daughter
of Bartholomew Badlesmere, and wife in
1336 of John de Vere earl of Oxford (fig.
<a href="#Fig_55">55</a>), with a shield of Vere between lozenges
of Clare, Badlesmere (her father and herself),
Clare with label (mother), and FitzPayn
(first husband); (4) Maud, daughter of
Henry earl of Lancaster, married first to
William of Burgh earl of Ulster, and
secondly (in 1343-4) to Sir Ralph Ufford
(fig. <a href="#Fig_56">56</a>), with lozenges of Lancaster (father
and herself) above and Chaworth (mother)
below, and shields of Burgh and Ufford
(husbands); (5) Sybil, daughter of William
Montagu earl of Salisbury and Katharine
Graunson, with shield of FitzAlan with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>

</div>

<p>Alice, wife of Thomas of Heslerton,
has on her seal (impression 1374) a large
lozenge of the arms of Heslerton (<i>gules
six silver lions with gold crowns</i>) within a
quatrefoil, outside of which are four small
banners of arms with martlets between.</p>

<p>Lastly may be noted a seal of Roger
Foljambe, attached to a deed of 1396-7,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
having a lozenge of his arms (<i>a bend and
six scallop shells</i>) surrounded by his word or
motto.</p>

<p>But seals are not the only authorities
for the indiscriminate use of roundels and
lozenges as well as shields of arms. In the
Victoria and Albert Museum at South
Kensington is an enamelled coffer of late
thirteenth century work decorated with
lozenges of arms of England, Valence,
Dreux, Angoulême, Brabant, and Lacy.
The famous Syon cope <i>de opere Anglicano</i>,
also in the Victoria and Albert Museum,
has the existing orphrey filled with large
armorial roundels and lozenges, and its
border is composed of a stole and fanon
embroidered throughout with lozenges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
arms. (See fig. <a href="#Fig_57">57</a>.) Christchurch, Canterbury,
in 1315 possessed an albe 'sewn
with lozenges with the arms of the king
of England and of Leybourne,'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
another 'sewn with the arms of Northwode
and Ponyngg in squares';<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> also an
albe 'sewn with divers arms in lozenges
with purple frets with a stole and fanon of
the same work,'<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> evidently not unlike
those on the Syon cope.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 57</span>. The Syon Cope, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It may also be noted that the pillows
beneath the head of the effigy at Westminster
of Aveline countess of Lancaster
(<i>c.</i> 1275) are both covered with heraldic
lozenges: on the upper one with the arms
of her husband alternating with the lion of
Redvers; on the lower with the vair cross
on red of her father, William of Forz earl
of Albemarle. The gilt metal bed plate
under the effigy of William of Valence earl
of Pembroke (<i>ob.</i> 1296), likewise at Westminster,
is also covered with a lozengy
diaper of England and Valence, still bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a><br /><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
with the original enamel; the workmanship
of this, however, is probably French.</p>

<p>The restriction of the lozenge to the
arms of ladies has clearly therefore no
medieval precedent, and there is not any
reason why the modern custom should not
be set aside when for artistic reasons a shield
or roundel is preferable.</p>

<small>THE TREATMENT OF CRESTS</small></h2>

<p>Origin of Crests; Earliest examples of Crests;
Ways of wearing Crests; The Helm and its

Crests; Use of Crests other than by individuals;

<p>A crest was originally, as its name
reminds us, a tuft or plume on the head of
a bird. Such a plume or tuft, or bush
as it was often called, was fixed in early
times as an ornament on the top of a helm,
of which it thus formed the crest. Other
devices, such as could conveniently be so
worn, were soon used for the same purpose,
and like armorial bearings became associated
with particular individuals. In later
days when the helm enveloped the whole
head, the crest played a useful part in
revealing the wearer's identity, though his
face was hidden.</p>

<p>One of the earliest suggestions of a
crest in English armory appears on the
second great seal (of 1198) of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Richard I, whose cylindrical helm has a
leopard upon the cap with two wing-shaped
fans above turned in opposite directions.
On many seals of the second half of the
thirteenth century, as, for instance, on those
of Robert de Vere earl of Oxford (1263)
and Henry de Laci earl of Lincoln (1272),
the knight is represented as riding in full
armour, with the helm surmounted with a
fan-shaped plume, which is also repeated
upon the horse's head. (See also fig. <a href="#Fig_58">58</a> and
<a href="#PLATE_XI">pl. <span class="smcap">XI B</span></a>.)</p>

<p>An early use of a crest proper is furnished
by the seal of Roger of Leybourne (<i>ob.</i> 1284).
This shows his shield of arms (bearing six
lions) hung upon a tree, with his banner
(charged with one lion only) behind, and at
one side a helm with lion crest (<a href="#PLATE_XI">pl. <span class="smcap">XI A</span></a>).
Thomas of Berkeley in 1295 has upon his
seal a shield flanked by two mermaids and
surmounted by a helm carrying a mitre for
a crest. Thomas earl of Lancaster (1296)
on two separate seals has a wiver, or two-legged
dragon, upon his helm, and this again
is repeated upon his horse's head (fig. <a href="#Fig_59">59</a>).
The seal of his brother Henry of Lancaster,
appended to the Barons' Letter, also shows
his helm crested with a wiver (fig. <a href="#Fig_60">60</a>).
Two other early examples of crests on seals
from the Barons' Letter are shown in figs.
<a href="#Fig_61">61</a> and <a href="#Fig_62">62</a>. Sir John Peche, on a seal appended
to a deed of 1323-4, has his shield
flanked by wivers and surmounted by a
helm with squirrel crest. William Montagu
earl of Salisbury (1336-7), in the mounted
figure of himself on his fine seal, has a
demi-griffin fixed upon his crowned helm
(<a href="#PLATE_XII">pl. <span class="smcap">XII B</span></a>), and King Edward III shows
for the first time, on his seal of 1340, his
crest of a crowned leopard standing upon
the cap of estate which surmounts his helm.</p>

<p>During the first half of the fourteenth

the manner of representing crests, when
not being worn by their owners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>William Montagu earl of Salisbury
shows on his counterseal (<a href="#PLATE_XII">pl. <span class="smcap">XII A</span></a>) his
shield supported by two griffins, and
ensigned by the demi-griffin issuing from an
open crown which in his seal he carries upon
his helm. John Engayn, in 1349, has upon
the upper edge of his shield a wolf or fox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
walking under a tree. Henry duke of
Lancaster (1341) ensigns the shield of his
arms with a cap of estate surmounted by
a leopard (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XIII">XIII</a> C</span>); and Peter de
Mauley, the sixth of that name, in 1379-80
has a seal with his simple arms (<i>a bend</i>)

surmounted by a fierce dragon breathing
defiance (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XX">XX</a> B</span>). In none of these cases
does a helm appear.</p>

<p>After the middle of the fourteenth
century the crest is invariably shown as
part of the helm.</p>

<p>The helm, it is hardly necessary to say,
was such an one as formed part of the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
harness of the time, and in the numerous
armorial representations that may be found
on seals or on monuments or buildings it
is almost invariably shown in profile. This
was, however, merely on account of its
being the most convenient way of displaying
the crest, and, in accordance with
the usual medieval common-sense, examples
are to be found which show the helm and
crest facing the observer.</p>

<p>Thus Thomas de Holand (1353) has on
his seal a shield of his arms hung from a
tree and flanked by two fronting helms,
each encircled by a crown and surmounted
by a huge bush of feathers; Sir Robert de
Marni (1366) flanks his shield, which is
also hung from a tree, with two fronting
helms, each crested with a tall pair of wings
rising from the sides of a cap of estate (fig.
<a href="#Fig_63">63</a>); Sir Stephen Hales (1392-3) on his seal
has a couched shield of his arms surmounted
by a fronting helm, with a crown about it
from which issue two fine wings; Robert
Deynelay (1394-5) in like manner shows
his helm crested with two ears of a bat or
hare; and Walter lord FitzWalter (1415-31)
has on his seal a couched shield, and
on a fronting helm above a cap of estate
surmounted by a star between two large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
wings (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XIII">XIII</a> A</span>). Another example of
a fronting helm is shown in pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_V">V</a> B</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The present custom of using various
types of helm facing different ways to
denote grades of rank is comparatively
recent as well as often inconvenient, and
utterly subversive of the proper method of
displaying a crest, which should invariably
face the same way as its wearer. This fact
is amply illustrated by the early stall-plates
at Windsor, but the modern crested helms
surmounting the stalls there were for a long
time the scoff of students of heraldry owing
to the absurd manner in which the crests
were set athwart the fronting helms. It is
pleasant to be able to add that the crests
have lately been replaced almost throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
by a new and larger series, worthy of their
surroundings, and set upon the helms in
the proper way. Under the same enlightened
administration the most recent
stall-plates are enamelled creations of real
artistic and heraldic excellence.</p>

<p>The crest was, of old time, almost always
something that could actually be set upon
a helm, and such objects as naturally were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a><br /><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a><br /><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
too large or too heavy were modelled in
boiled leather, wood, or other light material:
like the fine crest borne at the funeral of
Edward prince of Wales, now over his
tomb at Canterbury, which is a leopard
standing upon a cap of estate and modelled
in leather covered with stamped gesso
(fig. <a href="#Fig_65">65</a>); or the soldan's head of carved

<p>Such impossible crests as the pictorial
scenes and other absurdities granted by the
kings-of-arms during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries, and even back to
Elizabethan days, would not have been
thought of at an earlier period, when
heraldry was a living art.</p>

<p>The degradation of the proper use of a
crest, other than by those entitled to wear
one, began as soon as the kings-of-arms
presumed to grant armorial bearings by
their bestowing crests upon impersonal
corporate bodies like the London livery
companies, such as the Tallow Chandlers
(1456), Masons (1472), and Wax Chandlers
(1485-6).</p>

<p>Arms were borne by the mayor and
commonalty of a city or town at least as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
early as 1283 in the case of Chester, and of
1305 in the case of Dover (or the Cinque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Ports), but none presumed to use a crest
until London did so on the making of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
new seal in 1539, and no crest was
granted to a town before 1561.</p>

<p>Before leaving crests a word must be
said as to their comparative sizes.</p>

<p>Throughout the best period of heraldic
art the crested helm and the shield in
pictorial representations practically balance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
one another, but there is occasionally a
tendency to diminish the shield, and so
apparently to enlarge the crest. This may
be seen, for example, in several of the early
stall-plates at Windsor (figs. <a href="#Fig_67">67</a>, <a href="#Fig_68">68</a>), which
otherwise are admirable models as to the
treatment of crests in general. They also
show very clearly how easily and comfortably
the crests surmount the helms.</p>

<small>MANTLINGS</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Origin of Mantlings; Simple early forms;
Colours of Mantlings; Medieval usage as to
colours of Mantlings.</p></div>


<p>In actual use the helm seems often to have
been covered behind by a hanging scarf or
cloth of some kind, perhaps to temper the
heat of the sun, like a modern puggaree.
Heraldically this is represented by what is
now called the mantling.</p>

<p>At first this was a simple affair, worn
puggaree-wise, but by degrees it was
enlarged in representations until it extended
on either side beyond the helm,
and was disposed in graceful twists and
folds with dagged edges, which have been
supposed to represent the cuts it was liable
to receive during fighting (figs. <a href="#Fig_70">70</a>, <a href="#Fig_71">71</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The usual colour for the mantling, for a
long time, has been red, and its lining of
ermine or white fur, but there is ample
precedence for a difference of treatment, as
may be seen in that rich collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
ancient heraldic art, the stall-plates at
Windsor.</p>

<p>The earliest surviving plate, that of
Ralph lord Bassett (K.G. 1368-90), has a
short black mantling, to match the boar's
head that forms his crest (fig. <a href="#Fig_72">72</a>). A large
group of plates set up in 1421 exhibits a
considerable variety. Thus the plate of Sir
Sanchet Dabrichecourt has a red mantling
powdered with gold lozenges, a treatment
suggested by two bands of red similarly
decorated which encircle the bush of
feathers forming his crest (fig. <a href="#Fig_73">73</a>). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
mantling of William lord Latimer is of red
and silver stripes, and that of John lord
Beaumont, like the field of his shield, is,
together with the cap of estate, of blue
powdered with gold fleurs-de-lis. Sir
Walter Pavely has also a blue mantling.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir William FitzWaryn's mantling is
quarterly per fesse indented of red
and ermine, like his shield of arms.
The Captal de Buch, Raynald lord
Cobham, Hugh lord Burnell (fig. <a href="#Fig_77">77</a>),
Hugh lord Bourchier (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XVI">XVI</a></span>), and Sir
Thomas Banastre have black mantlings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a><br /><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and John lord Bourchier and William
lord Willoughby d'Eresby (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XV">XV</a></span>) white
mantlings lined with red. Sir Miles<span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Stapleton and the Soudan de la Trau have
black mantlings lined with red. Several
early mantlings, too, are formed entirely of
silver feathers, with red, black, or other
linings. These usually accompany a
feathered crest, like Sir William Arundel's
griffin (fig. <a href="#Fig_74">74</a>), or the earl of Warwick's
swan (fig. <a href="#Fig_75">75</a>), or Sir Thomas Erpingham's
bush of feathers. Another curious
variation, which is found on four early
plates, has the colour of the mantling
different on the two sides of the helm,
such as red on one side, and blue or
black on the other. In about a dozen
plates between 1450 and 1470 the red, and
in one case the blue, ground of a mantling
is relieved by a trailing pattern in gold,
sometimes in lines only, but more usually
as leafwork or flowers. In the plate of
Walter lord Hungerford (el. 1421) the
mantling on his banner-like plate is barred
with red and ermine (see fig. <a href="#Fig_136">136</a>), in
allusion to the arms of his lordship of
Hussey. Lastly, in the plate of Richard
lord Rivers (el. 1450) the mantling is red,
sown with gold trefoils, and lined with
white, with gold tassels at the ends (fig. <a href="#Fig_76">76</a>).
This is derived from the crest, which is the
upper part of a man brandishing a scimitar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and clad in a red tunic with standing collar
and large hanging sleeves, also sown with
trefoils. The sleeves are cleverly arranged
in the plate, as if forming part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
mantling, and are similarly dagged and
lined and tasselled. On the stall-plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
(<i>c.</i> 1483) of Francis viscount Lovel the
mantling is of purple sown with gold
hanging locks.</p>

<p>The crown was merely ornamental, and

<p>Beyond the fact that the thing was a
crown, there was no strict rule as to the
design, which varied according to the taste
of the artist. Two examples among the
early stall-plates at Windsor, those of Hugh
Stafford lord Bourchier (fig. <a href="#Fig_79">79</a> and pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XVI">XVI</a></span>)
and Richard lord Grey of Codnor (both
<i>c.</i> 1421), illustrate this in a pretty way
(fig. <a href="#Fig_80">80</a>). In both cases the plate after
being finished has been cut up, partly reversed,
and in part re-engraved; not because
anything was wrong with the heraldry,
but to make the crested helms face the other
way. These have accordingly been turned
over, but in cutting them afresh the engraver
has slightly varied the designs of
the crests and of the crowns with which
each is encircled, without however in any
way altering their heraldic character. In
the earliest existing plates the crested
helms are all drawn turned towards the
high altar, consequently those on the
north side of the quire face heraldically
towards the sinister. The two plates just
noted, and at least one other, have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
transferred from one side of the quire to
the other.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">PLATE XVI. STALL-PLATE OF WILLIAM LORD WILLOUGHBY,
C. 1421.</p></div>
</div>

<p>One of the first instances of a crown
about a crest is on the seal of William
Montagu earl of Salisbury, 1337 (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XII">XII</a></span>).</p>

<p>Crowns were not by any means always
of gold or silver, and quite a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
pre-Tudor stall-plates have them enamelled
red, and in two cases blue.</p>

<p>These heraldic crowns must not be confounded
with the coronets, as they are now
called, worn of different patterns by peers
and peeresses according to their degree;
some reference to these will be made later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>The cap of estate is generally depicted
in English heraldic art as a high crowned
conical hat or cap with flattened top, and
a broad brim lined with ermine. The
brim is usually turned up high in front,
but gradually lessens along the sides towards
the back, where the brim extends
horizontally to its full width.</p>

<p>The cap of estate first appears, surmounted
by his leopard crest, on the head
of King Edward III in the great seal made
for him in February 1339-40 on his assumption
of the title of King of France.
Whether the cap has any connexion with
the assumption of the king's new title it is
difficult to say, but its more common name
of 'cap of maintenance' would acquire a
significant meaning could such connexion
be proved. It is however more probable
that the cap was worn by the king for his
dignity of duke of Normandy and of
Aquitaine, and it was long the custom for
representatives of those duchies to take
part in coronation processions wearing
robes and caps of estate. According to the
<i>Little Device</i> for the coronation of Henry
VII, there were to ride before the king in
the procession from the Tower 'ij Squiers
for the kinges bodie bearing in baudrick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>

reprecentacion of the kinges twoo duchesses
of Gyen and Normandie.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Although the cap may at first have been
restricted to the king, it was certainly used
by the sons of Edward III, and may be
seen of like form and fashion upon the
seals of Edward as prince of Wales (1343),
of John of Gaunt as duke of Lancaster
(1362) and of Edmund of Langley as duke
of York (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXI">XXI</a></span>), and of Thomas of Woodstock
as duke of Gloucester in 1385. It
was no doubt in each case given by personal
investiture by the Sovereign, but only
to those who were made dukes.</p>

<p>In heraldry, however, the cap of estate
was used after 1350 by many who were
not only dukes who had been invested with
it, but by earls and barons who had not
been so invested, and even by mere
knights (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XIII">XIII</a> F</span>).</p>

<p>It would be as rash to argue from this
that such persons were all entitled to wear
for dignity the cap of estate as it would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
to insist that the equally common use of a
crown round the base of a crest entitled
every knight or baron on whose seal it
occurs to wear a coronet.</p>

<p>The colour of the cap of estate was
almost invariably red, with a lining of
ermine, but in two of the early stall-plates
it is blue. The crest is generally placed
directly upon it, but representations of two-legged
or four-legged creatures often stand
upon the brim with their feet on either side
of the flat-topped cap (figs. <a href="#Fig_112">112</a>, <a href="#Fig_138">138</a>). It
is hardly necessary to say that the crested
cap is always placed upon the helm, with
the mantling issuing from under it.</p>

<p>It is a common practice nowadays,
quite wrongly, to represent crests apart
from the helm, and as standing upon a
twisted bar, or wreath as it is called. A
little research will show that this bar represents
the twisting together of two or
three differently coloured stuffs, and fixing
the wreath so formed round the base of
the crest to mask its junction with the top
of a helm. Once invented it came into
common use, and crests of all kinds were
fixed within it.</p>

<p>When seen sideways the rounded top of
the helm causes the crest to appear as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
standing upon the wreath, and this has no
doubt given rise to the present malpractice.</p>

<p>The Rev. C. Boutell in his smaller
<i>English Heraldry</i> quotes the Hastings brass
at Elsing, of the year 1347, as the earliest
instance of a wreath about a crest (fig. <a href="#Fig_81">81</a>).
But this brass is probably French, and in
English work the wreath does not come
into being much before the close of the
fourteenth century, and was not regularly
used until about 1450.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 81.</span> Helm with crest and wreath, from
the Hastings brass at Elsing, 1347.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The wreath or torse, as it was also called,
from being a twist, was usually of two
colours, derived from the principal metal
and colour of the arms; but the fifteenth
century stall-plates show many variations
from this rule. Thus Lewis lord Bourchier
(<i>c.</i> 1421) has a torse of blue, gold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
black, and John earl of Tankerville
(<i>c.</i> 1421) one of green, red, and white.
John lord Bourchier (<i>c.</i> 1421) and Henry
lord Bourchier (<i>c.</i> 1452) both have black
and green torses. Richard Wydville lord
Rivers (<i>c.</i> 1450) has the crest issuing from
a green torse, crested with a crown of holly
leaves. Thomas lord Stanley (<i>c.</i> 1459)
has a torse of gold and blue with red
spots or jewels between, and Sir William
Chamberlayne (<i>c.</i> 1461) a red and blue
torse.</p>

<p>The modern practice is that the twists
of a torse shall be only six in number;
but in old heraldry there was no such rule,
and any number from four may be found,
whatever would look best. In the Harsick
brass (fig. <a href="#Fig_82">82</a>) there are eleven twists.</p>

</div>

<p>Crests occasionally had mottoes or
'words' associated with them, quite apart
from the ordinary 'word' or 'reason' of
the family or individual. Thus the ermine
bush of feathers that formed the crest of
Sir Simon Felbrigge is accompanied on his
stall-plate (<i>c.</i> 1421) by a scroll lettered
<span class="blackletter">Sanz muer</span> (fig. <a href="#Fig_83">83</a>), and on that of John
lord Scrope (el. 1461) the crest, which is
likewise a bush of feathers, has above it the
'reason' <span class="blackletter">autre qz-elle</span>. Two of the fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>

<p>From what has been said above as to
the ancient association of helm and crest,
it follows that the present fashion of representing
the crest by itself, apart from
the helm to which it was always attached,
is entirely wrong. It at once renders the
crest meaningless: in appearance it forthwith
becomes insignificant; and attempts
to treat it artistically generally end in
failure.</p>

<p>Let crests be shown as crests, properly
set upon practicable helms, and with
competent mantlings treated with all the
freedom that they are capable of.</p>

<p>It may here be noted that it has not been
customary, nor is it logically correct, for
ladies and other non-combatant persons,
such as the ministers of the Church, to use
crests; arms they have ever been allowed
to bear. Examples, however, of the breach
of the rule as to crests even by bishops
are afforded by several of their privy seals.
Thus Henry le Despenser bishop of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
Norwich (1370-1406) has his differenced
shield of arms surmounted by a mantled
helm upon which a mitre, with a griffin's
head and wings issuing therefrom, is placed
as a crest (fig. <a href="#Fig_84">84</a>); and Alexander Nevill
archbishop of York (1374) shows his shield
hanging below a crowned helm surmounted
by the bull's head crest of his house and
supported by two griffins.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 84.</span> Privy seal of Henry le Despenser

</div>

<p>William Courtenay, as archbishop of
Canterbury (1381-96), similarly displays a
shield of his arms, ensigned by a helm surmounted
by a cap of estate with a dolphin
on top. A helm crested with a lovely
bunch of columbines is also carved with
his arms above the tomb of James Goldwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
bishop of Norwich (<i>ob.</i> 1498-9) in his
cathedral church.</p>

<p>Robert Nevill on his privy seal as bishop
of Durham (1438-57) surmounts his shield
with a beautiful labelled mitre, from which
issues a bull's head with a scroll lettered
<span class="blackletter">en grace affie</span>.</p>

<p>Many of the bishops of Durham, on
their great seals in chancery, in virtue of
their secular palatinate jurisdiction, are
represented as riding in complete armour
with helms on their heads. The first to
be so represented was Thomas Hatfield
(1345), who wears a large crowned helm
surmounted by a mitre, from which issues
a bush of feathers. John Fordham (1381)
also surmounts his crowned helm with a
mitre, on which is perched a bird. Walter
Skirlaw (1388) and Thomas Langley (1406)
set within the crowns crests without mitres;
in one case the bust of an angel, in the
other a bush of feathers. Robert Nevill
(1438) surmounts his crowned helm with
a mitre, from which issues a bull's head, as
on his privy seal above noted. Cuthbert
Tunstall (1530) has a mitre alone upon his
helm.</p>

<p>The usual practice in displaying a bishop's
arms has been, for a long time, to ensign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
them simply with his own official headgear
in the shape of a mitre, and the same
custom prevailed with regard to the arms
of mitred abbots and priors. Robert
Nevill's privy seal is an early example.</p>

<p>Cardinals ensigned their shields with the
tasselled hat of their order, as may be seen
on the seal-of-arms of Henry Beaufort
bishop of Winchester (1405), and in a
carving of his arms in Southwark cathedral
church. A cardinal's hat is displayed, with
his rebus and sundry royal badges, on the
arch about the cenotaph of John Morton
archbishop of Canterbury and cardinal in
the undercroft of his cathedral church.</p>

<p>Doctors also sometimes surmounted their
arms with the round cap pertaining to their
dignity.</p>

<p>On the monument at St. Albans of
Humphrey duke of Gloucester (<i>ob.</i> 1446)
his arms are ensigned alternately by his
mantled and crested helm, and by a large
cap of estate encircled by a crown or coronet.
Jasper duke of Bedford (1485) on his
seal likewise surmounts his arms with a
cap of estate encircled by a delicate crown.</p>

<p>There is not any necessity at the present
day to represent any crown or coronet with
the cap of estate within it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a>
<br />
<small>THE USE OF BADGES, KNOTS, AND
THE REBUS</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Definition of a Badge; Difference between
Crests and Badges; Examples of Badges; The
Ostrich-Feather Badge; The White Hart, etc.;
Introduction of Badges into Heraldry; Their
Prevalence; Allusive Badges; Badges of obscure
Origin; Knots and Badges; The Rebus.</p></div>


<p>Closely allied with crests, but borne and
used in an entirely different way, are the
devices called badges.</p>

<p>The whole history of these is in itself
of great interest, and the facility with which
they lend themselves to artistic heraldic
decoration renders badges of peculiar value.</p>

<p>A badge is, properly speaking, any distinctive
device, emblem, or figure assumed
as the mark or cognisance of an individual
or family; and it should be borne alone,
without any shield, torse, or other accessory.
But a badge may be and often was, like a
crest, accompanied by a word, reason,
or motto. There is however this important
difference between a crest and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
badge, that the crest was pre-eminently the
personal device of its owner, while his
badge might also be used by his servants
and retainers. Such a use of the badge
still survives in the 'crest' on the buttons
of liveried servants.</p>

<p>The most famous and best known badge
is that of the three ostrich feathers encircled
by a crown or coronet borne by the
Prince of Wales. It was probably introduced
by Queen Philippa, who is known
to have possessed plate ornamented with
'a black scocheon of ostrich feathers,'
perhaps allusive of the Comté of Ostrevant,
the appanage of the eldest sons of the
house of Hainault. A single ostrich
feather, alone or stuck in a scroll, occurs
after 1343 in several seals of Edward
prince of Wales, and on his tomb at
Canterbury the shield of his own arms
alternates with his mother's black shield
with three silver ostrich feathers, each transfixing
a scroll with the word <span class="blackletter">ich diene</span>;
over the shield is likewise a scroll inscribed
with the same words (<a href="#Fig_85">fig. 85</a>).
John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster is said
to have borne an ostrich feather powdered
with ermine tails, and Thomas of Woodstock
duke of Gloucester, the youngest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
of Queen Philippa's sons, bore the feathers
with a strap (which some have regarded as
a Garter) extended along the quill (<a href="#Fig_86">fig. 86</a>).
The Queen's great-grandson, Richard duke
of York and earl of March (1436), bore
the feather with a chain similarly placed;
perhaps Edmund of Langley, his grandfather,
had done the same. Henry of
Lancaster, the son of John of Gaunt, on his
seal as earl of Derby in 1385 (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIV">XXIV</a> C</span>)
and on that as duke of Hereford in 1399,
has an ostrich feather stuck in the end
of a scroll which is entwined about the
feather and inscribed with the significant
word <span class="blackletter">souvereyne</span>, and the same word is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
repeated many times on his tomb as King
Henry IV at Canterbury.</p>

</div>

<p>When badges first came into use in this
country is uncertain, but after the middle
of the fourteenth century they abound.
They are foreshadowed by the free treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ment
of earlier decorative heraldry, such as
the little leopards on the footgear and
pillows of King Henry III's gilt-latten
effigy at Westminster, and the plate with
its lozengy diaper of leopards on which it
lies; also the lozengy diaper of castles
and lions which covers the metal plate
whereon lies the effigy of Queen Eleanor
of Castile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Many badges, too, originated in devices
borrowed from various sources and arranged
about the shield on seals, as in figs. <a href="#Fig_89">89</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>

<p>The gilt-latten effigies of Richard II
(fig. <a href="#Fig_92">92</a>) and Anne of Bohemia have their
dresses pounced all over with badges, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
as the white hart, the sun-burst, and the
broom sprigs on that of the king, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
ostrich and a peculiar knot on that of the
queen. In 1380 Edmund Mortimer earl of
March left a bequest of 'our large bed
of black satin embroidered with white lions
and gold roses, with scocheons of the arms
of Mortimer and Ulster,' and in 1385
Joan princess of Wales bequeathed to
her son the King (Richard II) 'my new
bed of red velvet embroidered with ostrich
feathers of silver and leopards' heads
of gold with boughs and leaves issuing
from their mouths.' In 1397, Sir Ralph
Hastings, whose arms were a red maunch
or sleeve on a gold ground, and his crest
a bull's head, left bequests of a silver bason
and laver 'stamped with a bull's head
(<i>cum capite tauri</i>), a vestment of red cloth
of gold with orfreys before and behind
worked with maunches (<i>cum maunches</i>) and
with the colours of mine arms,' and six
salts stamped with maunches. In 1388
John of Gaunt duke of Lancaster mentions
in his will 'my great bed of cloth of
gold, the field powdered with roses of gold
set upon pipes of gold, and in each pipe
two white ostrich feathers,' also 'my new
vestment of cloth of gold the field red
worked with gold falcons.' Two falcons
holding hanging locks in their beaks are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
shown on one of the duke's seals (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXI">XXI</a> A</span>).
In 1400 Thomas Beauchamp earl of Warwick
left a bed of silk embroidered with
'bears of mine arms'; and in 1415 John lord
le Scrope mentions in his will documents
sealed <i>cum signato meo de Crabb</i>, and in a
codicil made in 1453 he bequeaths 'j fayre
pile of coppis conteyning xij coppis of gilt,
with crabbis in ye myddes, and two
coveryngis to thame with crabb.' In the
north of England a crab is often called a
scrap, whence its assumption by the Scropes.</p>

<p>Such examples as the foregoing could be
multiplied indefinitely, but they will suffice
to show the prevalence of badges and the
many ways in which they were used.
They of course abounded on seals as well
as on monuments of all kinds, and in conjunction
with architecture. Under this last
head may be quoted such examples as the
arches in Wingfield church, Suffolk (fig. <a href="#Fig_93">93</a>),
studded with leopards' heads, wings, and
Stafford knots, commemorative of Michael
de la Pole earl of Suffolk (<i>ob.</i> 1415) and
his wife Katharine Stafford; the porch and
other parts of Lavenham church, displaying
the boars and molets of John de Vere earl
of Oxford; bishop Courtenay's chimney-piece
in the bishop's palace at Exeter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a><br /><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a><br /><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a><br /><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a><br /><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a><br /><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
(fig. <a href="#Fig_94">94</a>); and the great displays of Tudor
badges on the deanery gateway at Peterborough
(fig. <a href="#Fig_95">95</a>), the gatehouses at Christ's
(fig. <a href="#Fig_96">96</a>) and St. John's Colleges (fig. <a href="#Fig_172">172</a>) at
Cambridge, and the noble chapel of King's
College. Special mention must also be
made of the magnificent bronze doors of
Henry VII's chapel at Westminster, than
which no more beautiful example of the use
of badges for decorative purposes could
possibly be found (fig. <a href="#Fig_97">97</a>).</p>

<p>The sources of badges were various. As
a matter of fact a man's badge was often
the same device as his crest, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Courtenay dolphin, or the boar of the
Veres, or the sickle of the Hungerfords.
Sometimes the badge was derived from a
part of the arms, such as the leopards'
heads and the wings of the de la Poles, the
water-bougets of the Bourchiers (fig. <a href="#Fig_98">98</a>),
the silver molet of the Veres (fig. <a href="#Fig_99">99</a>), and
the Phelip eagle (fig. <a href="#Fig_100">100</a>). If by chance
a badge could have any punning or allusive
meaning it was the more popular, and it
then often served as a rebus. The boar
(<i>verre</i>) of the Veres (fig. <a href="#Fig_99">99</a>), the crab or
scrap of the Scropes, the pike or luce of
the Lucys, the long swords of Longespee
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XIX">XIX</a> A</span>), the <i>gray</i> or badger of Richard
lord Grey of Codnor (fig. <a href="#Fig_102">102</a>), and the
wood-stock or tree stump of Thomas duke
of Gloucester, who was born at Woodstock,
are all good examples of a practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
that should be followed whenever possible,
even in these degenerate days.</p>

<p>But in a large number of cases the badge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
has a different and often quite obscure

the Zouch eagle and crooked billet, and the

<p>A few families, <i>e.g.</i> the Staffords (fig.
<a href="#Fig_105">105</a>), the Bourchiers, and the Wakes, used
as a badge some special form of knot, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
attention has already been called to the
peculiar knots pounced upon the effigy of
Queen Anne of Bohemia. Interesting
examples of the Bourchier knot may be
seen on the tomb of archbishop Thomas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Bourchier at Canterbury, and on the brass
of Sir Humphrey Bourchier at Westminster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a><br /><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
(fig. <a href="#Fig_106">106</a>), and a good instance of the application
of the knot is afforded by the seal of
Joan Stafford countess of Kent and lady of
Wake, who encircles her impaled shield
with a cordon of Stafford knots (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XVIII">XVIII</a> D</span>).
On the tomb at Lowick (Northants) of
Edward Stafford earl of Wiltshire (<i>ob.</i> 1498)
the shields are encircled with cordons of
Stafford knots with another Stafford badge,
the nave of a wheel, alternating with the
knots (fig. <a href="#Fig_107">107</a>). On the canopy of the tomb
at Little Easton in Essex of Henry Bourchier
earl of Essex (<i>ob.</i> 1483) and his wife
Isabel, sister of Richard duke of York, is a
badge formed by placing a Bourchier knot
within a fetterlock of York.</p>

<p>Mention has been made above of the
rebus. This was invariably a badge or
device forming a pun upon a man's surname,
and at one time was exceedingly
popular. It no doubt originated in the
canting or allusive heraldry of earlier
days, like the boars' heads of the Swynburnes,
the trumpets of the Trumpingtons,
the hammers (Fr. <i>martel</i>) of the Martels,
or the scallop shells of the Scales. The <i>ox</i>
crossing a <i>ford</i> in the arms of Oxford, and
the <i>Cam</i> and its great <i>bridge</i> in the arms of
Cambridge are also kindred examples. A
large number of rebuses on names ending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a><br /><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in 'ton' are based upon a tun or barrel,
like the <i>lup</i> on a <i>ton</i> of Robert Lupton
provost of Eton 1503-4, or the large
church (<i>kirk</i>) and <i>ton</i> of abbot Kirkton on
the deanery gate at Peterborough (fig. <a href="#Fig_108">108</a>),
or the <i>beacon</i> rising from a <i>ton</i> of bishop
Thomas Beckington at Wells (fig. <a href="#Fig_109">109</a>).
The <i>gold wells</i> of bishop Goldwell and the
<i>harts ly</i>ing in <i>water</i> of bishop Walter Lyhart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
in their cathedral church at Norwich are well
known, as are probably the <i>eye</i> and the <i>slip</i>
of a tree which form, together with a man
falling from a tree (I slip!), the rebuses of
abbot Islip at Westminster (fig. <a href="#Fig_110">110</a>). An
<i>ox</i>, the letter N, and a <i>bridge</i> make the rebus
of canon John Oxenbridge in his chantry
chapel at Windsor, while an eagle and an
<i>ox</i> with <span class="blackletter">ne</span> on his side gives the name of
prior John Oxney at Christchurch, Canterbury.
Two large <i>hares</i> with a spring or <i>well</i>
rising between them crouch at the feet of
bishop Harewell's effigy at Wells; and dean
Gunthorpe's oriel window in the deanery
there is decorated with <i>guns</i> (fig. <a href="#Fig_111">111</a>). Sir
John Pechey's arms (<i>azure a lion ermine with
a forked tail and a gold crown</i>), in a window
in Lullingstone church, Kent, are encircled
by a wreath of peach-branches, with peaches
charged with the letter <span class="blackletter">e</span> for the final
syllable of his name (fig. <a href="#Fig_112">112</a>).</p>

<p>Here again it is needless to multiply

<p>The misuse of crests to which reference
has been made unfortunately does not
stand alone, for modern artists are quite as
much at fault with regard to the proper
treatment of supporters.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that these
charming adjuncts to heraldic compositions
originated with the seal engravers, in their
desire to fill up the vacant space in a round
seal between the shield and its surrounding
margin. In the oldest examples this was
done by adding scrollwork or leafage, but
in the seal of Humphrey Bohun earl of
Hereford, 1220, the large shield of his
arms is flanked by two smaller shields of
his other earldom of Essex. The same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
treatment occurs in the seal of his grandson,
another Humphrey Bohun earl of
Hereford and Essex, 1298-1322 (pl.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XIX">XIX</a> B</span>). Henry de Laci (1257) has the
side spaces filled by two small wivers, and
in the seal of Stephen Longespee (<i>ob.</i> 1260)
the shield is flanked by two <i>long swords</i>
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XIX">XIX</a> A</span>). Gilbert of Clare earl of
Gloucester (1262) has his shield hung on
a peg and accompanied by two lions back
to back, while in the seal of Edmund earl
of Cornwall (1272) and son of Richard king
of the Romans the shield is held up in
the beak of an imperial eagle splayed or
spread out behind it. Thomas earl of
Lancaster (1296) on both his larger and
his lesser seals has the shield flanked by
two wivers, as has also his brother Henry
of Lancaster (1298) (fig. <a href="#Fig_60">60</a>).</p>

<p>Sometimes the shield is hung about the
neck of a bird (fig. <a href="#Fig_113">113</a>), or about a beast,
as in the seal of Alan la Souche, which
likewise has the shield surrounded by a
number of lions (fig. <a href="#Fig_114">114</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>During the first half of the fourteenth
century little definite progress was made
towards true supporters. Shields, whether
hung from pegs or upon trees, or surmounted
by crested helms, still continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
to be flanked by quasi-supporters, which of
course varied much in character.
Pairs of wivers, dragons, and lions,
usually back to back, the better to fit the
space, and sometimes with entwined tails,
were common early in the century, and
shields with splayed eagles behind may
not infrequently be found (figs. <a href="#Fig_115">115</a>, <a href="#Fig_116">116</a>).
What may be regarded as true supporters
appear on the lesser seal (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XII">XII</a> A</span>) of
William Montagu earl of Salisbury (<i>circa</i>
1337), wherein two griffins seem to be
holding up the shield, but it is not until
well on in the second half of the fourteenth
century that further definite instances become
fairly common.</p>

<p>Interesting transitional usages may also
be found. Thus on a seal (<i>c.</i> 1350) of
Margaret Graunson two wivers uphold by
their beaks the upper corners of a shield of
her husband's arms, while a third wiver
similarly grips the point. Guy de Bryen
(<i>c.</i> 1350) has his shield hung upon a tree
and supported at the corners by two wivers
holding it by their beaks. Another
lady, Joan FitzAlan, who married in 1362
Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford, has
an impaled shield of their arms held up in
their beaks by two Bohun swans; and
another pair of swans perform the same
office in a FitzWarin seal used in 1398-9
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XX">XX</a> A</span>).</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>A curious variant from the ordinary
flanking pair of beasts occurs on the seal
of Edmund Mortimer earl of March
(1360-81), where the arms are accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
by a pair of lions with their heads covered
by large helms with the earl's crest, a bush
of feathers rising from a crown. A similar
treatment is to be seen on a seal of John
la Warre, as used in 1390 (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XX">XX</a> D</span>).</p>

<p>Analogous cases will be noted on the
seal of Sir Robert de Marni (1366) (fig.
<a href="#Fig_64">64</a>), whose shield hangs from a tree and is
flanked by two fronting helms with tall
pairs of wings rising from caps of estate as
crests; also in a seal of Sir Bartholomew
Burghersh (1397-8), which has the shield
flanked by two helms crested with tall
soldans' heads, and surmounted by what
is probably his badge, a swan with a lady's
head (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XX">XX</a> C</span>). A seal of Sir Roger
Scales (1369-86) has his seal flanked by
two long-necked wivers, and hung by a
strap from another wiver which has twisted
itself into the shape of the letter S, and
perched itself on the upper edge of the
shield.</p>

<p>Another case of true supporters is
afforded by a seal of Peter de Mauley in
1379-80, where a shield surmounted by a
fierce dragon (perhaps a badge) is upheld
by small lions (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XX">XX</a> B</span>). Other supporters
of shields only may be seen on seals of
Thomas Beauchamp earl of Warwick (1369),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
where they are bears; and of Roger Mortimer
earl of March and Ulster (1381),
where they are lions, as is also the case in
a seal of John Batour used in 1418-9.
In each of these cases the shield is hung
upon a tree.</p>

<p>In heraldic representations where the
shield of arms is surmounted by a helm
and crest, there is the same hesitation in
arriving at true supporters; the space at
the sides being filled at first by a badge
or such device. Thus John of Gaunt
duke of Lancaster (in 1362) introduced a
pair of eagles with hanging locks in
their beaks, and his brother Edmund of
Langley duke of York (in 1385) followed
suit with a couple of falcons having in their
beaks scrolls with scriptures (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXI">XXI</a></span>).
John Nevill lord of Raby and seneschal of
Bordeaux (1378) flanked his arms, etc. with
two letters <span class="blackletter">b</span>, while his kinsman, Sir William
Nevill, used in 1390 a seal with his arms
and crested helm accompanied by two large
stars.</p>

<p>The fine seal of Thomas lord Despenser
(before 1397) has on either side of his
shield and crested helm a tree from which
hangs a lozenge of arms: the one bearing
the three cheverons of Clare, for his lordship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of Glamorgan; the other the forked-tailed
lion of the barony of Burghersh,
which came to him through his mother
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXII">XXII</a> A</span>). Richard Nevill earl of Salisbury
in 1429 similarly places two angels
bearing shields: one with the arms of
Nevill, the other with the lions of Longespee
in virtue of his earldom of Salisbury (pl.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXII">XXII</a> B</span>). Henry of Lancaster (afterwards
King Henry IV) as earl of Derby, etc.
(<i>c.</i> 1385) flanks his arms and crested helm
with two ostrich feathers entwined with a
scroll with the scripture <span class="blackletter">souvereyne</span> (pl.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIV">XXIV</a> C</span>), and others of the royal house
similarly used ostrich feathers of other
forms. Edward V as prince of Wales in
1471 flanked his arms with two scrolled
ostrich feathers standing on large York
roses. Thomas duke of Exeter (1416)
placed a swan on either side of his armorial
achievement, and William lord Lovel and
Holand (1423) a hanging lock (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIII">XXIII</a> A</span>);
while Sir John Pelham (<i>c.</i> 1430) flanked
his crest with his buckle badge (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIII">XXIII</a> B</span>).
On the fine seal of Thomas lord Roos of
Hamlake or Helmsley (1431-64) his peacock
crest is flanked by two large flowering
plants, perhaps <i>hemlocks</i> (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIII">XXIII</a> E</span>).</p>

<p>By the third quarter of the fourteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
century the combination of supporters with
shields of arms surmounted by crested<span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
helms had become fully established, and
henceforth the number of beautiful and
instructive examples is so great that it is
unnecessary to do more than illustrate a
typical series (figs. <a href="#Fig_117">117</a>-<a href="#Fig_121">121</a>). It will be
seen from these that in seals the majority
of the supporters are upholding the heavy
helm and its crest, and not the shield that
hangs below it; probably on account of the
nature of the design. The supporters, too,
usually form pairs, and it goes without saying
that every variety of creature is made to
serve. Sometimes they are composed of
badges, like the falcons on crooked billets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
used by William lord Zouch (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIV">XXIV</a> A</span>),

<p>Where the supporters differ it is usually
the case that they represent more than one
dignity. Thus on one of his seals (fig. <a href="#Fig_124">124</a>)
Richard Beauchamp earl of Warwick (1401)
used as such for supporters two muzzled bears
hugging ragged staves, but on a later seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
(1421) as earl of Warwick and of Albemarle
the supporters are a bear and a griffin
(fig. <a href="#Fig_125">125</a>). So, too, his successor in the title
of earl of Warwick, Richard Nevill, on a fine
seal (<i>c.</i> 1451-2) has two muzzled bears for
supporters, but on a later seal (<i>c.</i> 1460) as
earl of Warwick and Salisbury his supporters
are a Warwick bear and a Montagu griffin
(fig. <a href="#Fig_69">69</a>). Edmund Beaufort duke of
Somerset on his seal for the town of Bayeux
(<i>c.</i> 1445) (fig. <a href="#Fig_126">126</a>) has on one side his own
eagle supporter, and on the other a spotted
dog-like beast with a crown about his neck;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and Richard duke of York and earl of March
on his seal as governor of France and Normandy
in 1436 has for supporters the York
falcon and the white lion of March. On
the stall-plate of John Beaufort duke of
Somerset and earl of Kendal his arms are
supported by a Somerset crowned eagle and
a mysterious beast called a yale,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> behind
each of which stands an ostrich feather with
the quill gobony of blue and silver.</p>

<p>It is not necessary here to cite the various
supporters borne by the Kings of England,
but it may suffice to point out that since
the union of the crowns of England and
Scotland one of the royal supporters has
always been a lion for England and the
other a unicorn for Scotland.</p>

<p>In seals of married ladies in which their
arms are accompanied by supporters, one
often represents the husband and the other
the lady's family.</p>

<p>Thus Joan Holand, daughter of Thomas
earl of Kent, and wife of Edmund of Langley
duke of York, has (after 1393) her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a><br /><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
husband's half of her impaled shield
supported by the falcon of York, and her
own half by her father's hind with its
crown collar. Cecily Nevill, the wife of
Richard duke of York and earl of March,
and mother of King Edward IV, has the
shield on her fine seal ensigned by a falcon
of York and supported by a stag with crown-collar
and chain and by a lion of March
(fig. <a href="#Fig_127">127</a>). The even more splendid seal of
Elizabeth Wydville, queen-consort of King
Edward IV, shows as her supporters the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
lion of March and a lean spotted beast not
unlike an otter, collared and chained (pl.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXV">XXV</a></span>). The lady Margaret Beaufort, on the
other hand, ensigns on both her seals her
paternal arms of Beaufort with the Somerset
eagle and uses for her supporters a pair of
yales (pls. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXVI">XXVI</a></span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXX">XXX</a></span>).</p>

<p>It is of course all-important that sup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>porters
should be shown standing upon
something solid, and not on so precarious
a footing as the edge of a motto or forked
scroll. One of the beautiful armorial
groups with the supporters of King Henry
VII in King's college chapel at Cambridge
(fig. <a href="#Fig_128">128</a>) shows how effectively and yet
unobtrusively this may be done. In the
splendid panel at New Hall in Essex with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the crowned arms, etc. of King Henry
VIII his dragon and greyhound supporters
stand in a bush of roses and pomegranates
(fig. <a href="#Fig_189">189</a>); and in the well-known glass at
Ockwells the supporters have fields full
of flowers to stand on.</p>

<p>Besides the more or less regular use of
supporters just described, there are a
number of curious and irregular ways of
supporting shields. These deserve special
attention, not only from their value in
showing how delightfully heraldry used to
be played with, but as precedents for similar
variety of treatment at the present day,
when supporters so-called often do not
support anything. Over the doorway, for
example, of the National Portrait Gallery
in London the 'supporters' of the royal
arms are merely a pair of cowering beasts
at the base of the shield.</p>

<p>Quite an early instance of playful treatment
is furnished by the seal of Roger
Leybourne (<i>ob.</i> 1284). This has a small
banner standing behind the shield, which
is hung on a tree with side branches; one
of these supports the crested helm, and the
other ends in a bunch of leaves (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XI">XI</a> A</span>).</p>

<p>Thomas lord Holand and Wake (<i>c.</i>
1353) has within a traceried panel a tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a><br /><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
standing in a rabbit warren and supporting
his crowned helm with its huge bush of
feathers. Hanging on either side are two
shields, one with beautiful diapering of his
lordship of Wake, the other (originally) of
his lordship of Holand (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXVII">XXVII</a> A</span>).</p>

<p>Thomas of Woodstock duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Gloucester, son of Edward III, used from
about 1385 a lovely seal with the stock of
a tree standing within a paling and surrounded
by water on which float two
chained Bohun swans, for his wife Eleanor
Bohun; from the tree hangs a large
shield of the duke's arms, with his crested
helm above, and from two side branches
are suspended diapered shields of the earldom
of Hereford (<i>azure two bends, one gold,
the other silver</i>), also in reference to his
Bohun marriage.</p>

<p>Margaret daughter of Richard Beauchamp
earl of Warwick, and wife of John
Talbot earl of Shrewsbury and Waterford,
in her fine shield (after 1433) suspends by
their straps her father's shield and the
impaled shield of her husband and herself
from the ragged staff of her father's house
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXVII">XXVII</a> B</span>).</p>

were <i>barry wavy with a crowned (?) leopard
rampant</i> (fig. <a href="#Fig_129">129</a>). A similar treatment
occurs on the half-florin of King Edward
III, which has for device a crowned sitting
leopard with a cloak about his neck with the
royal arms.</p>

<p>Banners also figure prominently on the
charming seal of Margaret lady of
Hungerford and Botreaux (1462) (pl.
<span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXVIII">XXVIII</a> B</span>). She was the daughter of
William lord Botreaux and Margaret Beaumont,
and wife of Sir Robert Hungerford,
who died in 1459. The seal shows the lady
in her widow's dress 'sitting upon her
knees' in a garden, and reading from a book
some words which are inscribed on a scroll
about her head. Overshadowing her are
two large banners of impaled arms: one of
Hungerford and Botreaux, upheld by a
lion; the other of Botreaux and Beaumont,
upheld by a griffin.</p>

<p>On many late thirteenth and early
fourteenth century seals it was not uncommon
to represent ladies holding up
shields of arms. A delightful example
that may be cited is that of Emmeline
FitzGerald, and wife of Stephen Longespee,
who is upholding her father's shield in her
right and her husband's in her left hand.
Below each shield is a leopard of England
to show her husband's close relationship to
the royal house, and on each side of her is
a <i>long sword</i>. She died in 1331 (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIX">XXIX</a> B</span>).</p>

<p>A few cases occur where a man himself
acts as the supporter of his arms. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of the shields of Henry Percy earl of
Northumberland (1377) shows him in
armour, standing behind a large shield of
Percy which he supports with his left
hand. His right is upon the hilt of a
sword with the belt wrapped about it, and
against his left shoulder rests a banner with
the Percy lion. The earl appears in similar
fashion in another of his seals as lord of
Cockermouth (1393). In this the shield is
quarterly of Percy and Lucy, and is grasped
as before by his left hand, while the right
holds up a pennon charged with his badge
of a crescent (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIX">XXIX</a> A</span>).</p>

<p>It must suffice to quote one last piece of
playfulness, a seal of Richard duke of
York and earl of March and Ulster (<i>ob.</i>
1460) as justice-in-eyre of the forests.
This has his shield of arms suspended
about the neck of a York falcon, and
enclosed by the horns of a buck's head in
base, in reference to his office. Upon the
buck's horns are fixed two small hands for
the duke's earldom of Ulster (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIX">XXIX</a> C</span>).</p>

<p>Representations of banners constantly
occur in medieval pictures (fig. <a href="#Fig_131">131</a>); and,
as has been shown above, they are not
infrequent upon seals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_131"></a>

</div>

<p>Every one is familiar with the banner of the
royal arms that betokens the presence of the
King, and with our splendid national banner
known as the Union Jack. The banner with
the arms of the city that is flown above the
Mansion House when the lord mayor is in
residence is familiar to Londoners, and the
citizens of Rochester are equally accustomed
to see the banner of their city flying on
Sundays and holidays from the great tower
of their castle. Let a banner once be regarded
in the light of a rectangular shield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and its fitness to contain armorial bearings
immediately becomes apparent. The King's
banner is now always miscalled 'the royal
standard,' even in official language, though
heraldically it is not a standard at all, but
simply a banner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Medieval banners at first were oblong
in shape, and set upright with a longer side
next the staff. In the late thirteenth
century pictures formerly in the painted
chamber in the palace of Westminster
the banners borne by the knights were
more than twice as tall as they were broad.
The same proportion survives even in
the famous pictorial pageant of Richard
Beauchamp earl of Warwick, drawn about
1493;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> but the majority of the banners
therein shown have a height one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
three-quarter times the width, which is
better for the display of heraldry. This is
also the proportion of the banners on
William lord Hungerford's seal (fig. <a href="#Fig_132">132</a>),
but the banners with impaled arms on lady
Hungerford's seal are nearly square (fig.
<a href="#Fig_133">133</a>). On the monument in Westminster
abbey church of Lewis lord Bourchier (<i>ob.</i>
1431) the large quartered banners at the
ends, upheld by lions and eagles, are slightly
less than a square and a half in area, and
admirably proportioned for displaying arms
(fig. <a href="#Fig_134">134</a>). The banner of King Edward IV,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a><br /><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
'which also hung over his grave' in St.
George's chapel in Windsor castle, is
described as of 'Taffaty, and thereon
painted quarterly France and England; it
had in breadth three foot four inches, besides
a Fringe of about an inch broad, and
in depth five foot and four inches, besides
the Fringe.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Ashmole, in his description
of the banners hung above the stalls of
the Knights of the Garter, states (in 1672)
that 'the fashion of the Soveraign's and
all the Knight-Companions Banners are
square; but it doth no where appear to us,
of what size their Banners anciently were;
yet in Queen Elizabeth's Reign, we find
them two yards and a quarter long, and a
yard and three quarters broad, beside the
Fringe (which is made of Gold or Silver
and Silk, of the colours in the Wreath) and
thereon are wrought or beaten upon
Taffaty-Sarcenet, double-Sarcenet, or rich
Taffaty, with fine Gold and Colours, on
both sides, the paternal Coat of the Knights
Companion, together with his Quarterings,
or so many of them as he please to make
use of, wherein Garter is to take care that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
they be warrantly marshalled.... These

</div>

<p>The remark here as to the quarterings,
in view of the comments upon them in an
earlier page of this book, is interesting, but
it is more important to note that both the
banner of King Edward IV, and those of the
Knights of the Garter in Queen Elizabeth's
time, were of similar proportions to those
on the Bourchier monument.</p>

<p>The fact is that the heraldic draughtsmen
of even this late period were fully
as aware as their predecessors of the difficulty
of drawing arms in a banner that exceeded
the width of a square, and they
also appreciated the greater advantage
of an area that was narrower than that
figure.</p>

<p>The longer form of banner may be
tolerated for so simple a combination as
the Union Jack, or even for such of its
component parts as the cross of St. Andrew
or the saltire of St. Patrick, but it is rarely
possible so to arrange heraldry upon it as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
to look well, and even the cross of St.
George looks better upright thus</p>

<p>
<img src="images/p_226a.png" width="100" height="166" alt="" />
than
<img src="images/p_226b.png" width="120" height="138" alt="" />
when extended unduly horizontally.</p>

<p>In the King's banner as at present borne
it is practically impossible to draw the arms
artistically, or with a proper balancing
relation of field and charge (fig. <a href="#Fig_135">135</a>). The
leopards of England may be so outrageously
lengthened and attenuated as nearly to fill
the quarters allotted to them, but it is impracticable
to display properly the upright
form of the ramping lion of Scotland or to
expand horizontally the Irish harp. In
the banner, too, of the lord mayor of
London as used on the Mansion House
to-day, the sword of St. Paul in the quarter
can only be drawn of the comparative size
of Sir William Walworth's dagger, which
it is in consequence so absurdly mistaken
to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="Fig_135"></a>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>Were, however, the King's arms (see
frontispiece) and those of his city of
London placed on upright oblong or even
square banners, all difficulties of drawing
them would be avoided, and from appearing
to be glaring examples of mean modern
heraldry they would forthwith become fine
pieces of artistic decoration.</p>

<p>A close approximation to the better way
of displaying the King's arms is illustrated
by the lately adopted banners of Queen
Mary and Queen Alexandra, both of which
show the Sovereign's arms impaling those
of his consort. The King's arms are thus
restricted to half the usual length of the
present 'royal standard,' that is, to a square,
and so can be drawn with less waste space
on either side of the charges.</p>

<p>Whatever be their shape, banners, like
shields, ought as a rule to be covered completely
with the heraldry, like the banners
of the Knights of the Garter at Windsor
(which, though modern, are quite good in
this respect) and those of more recent
institution of the Order of St. Michael and
St. George in St. Paul's cathedral church.</p>

<p>Examples are not lacking, even in the
fifteenth century, of banners charged with
regular heraldic achievements instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
arms, and quite an interesting series may be
found among the Windsor stall-plates. Two
small oblong plates of Sir Peter Courtenay
and Henry lord FitzHugh are practically
complete banners of their arms, but Walter
lord Hungerford (after 1426) displays his
arms, with helm, crest, and mantling, upon
a dull black banner with fringed gold
border attached to a writhen gilded staff
(fig. <a href="#Fig_136">136</a>). Richard Nevill earl of Salisbury
(<i>c.</i> 1436) (fig. <a href="#Fig_137">137</a>), John earl of Shrewsbury
(<i>c.</i> 1453), John lord Tiptoft (<i>c.</i> 1461),
and several others have their arms, etc.
on plain gold-coloured fringed banners,
but Richard lord Rivers (<i>c.</i> 1450), Thomas
lord Stanley (<i>c.</i> 1459), and George duke
of Clarence (<i>c.</i> 1461) have the field worked
all over with decorative scroll-work. Sir
John Grey of Ruthin (<i>c.</i> 1439) also displays
his arms on an undoubted banner with black
ground and gold fringe and staff (fig. <a href="#Fig_138">138</a>),
and William lord Fauconberg (<i>c.</i> 1440)
on a banner with the field bendy of blue
and silver, with a gold fringe and staff. It
is not improbable that several other quadrangular
stall-plates with coloured grounds
represent banners. Edmund of Langley
duke of York has the field paly of three
pieces of silver, green, and black; John duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
of Bedford (1422-3) has a ground party
blue and silver, and Thomas duke of
Exeter (<i>c.</i> 1422) a ground all black.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
John duke of Somerset (<i>c.</i> 1440) has
the field of his plate bendy of silver, red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and green, with a gilded border of scrolled
leaves; and Walter lord Mountjoy (<i>c.</i> 1472)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
disposes the same three colours in vertical
stripes.</p>

<p>Two similar displays of heraldic achievements
are to be found in a manuscript at
the Heralds' College.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> In one of these
the arms, etc. of Sir Richard Nanfant
(<i>ob.</i> 1506-7) are painted upon a quadrangular
field party of blue and green. In
the other the impaled shield of Sir Richard
and his dame, upheld by an angel, is painted
upon a ground having the upper three-fourths
red and the fourth part pale pink.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>In modern practice there is no conceivable
reason why banners for the display of arms
should not be more widely adopted; not
only as banners proper, to fly upon a staff,
but in decorative art, such as painting,
sculpture, and embroidery. Both the Royal
Society and the Society of Antiquaries
regularly notify their existence in Burlington
House by displaying banners of their arms
over their apartments, and their example is
one that might be followed by other corporations
entitled to bear arms. On the
use of banners by individuals it is unnecessary
to enter after the useful series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of examples and usages thereof already
noted.</p>

<p>The curious flags known as standards,
which were in use during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries, seem to have been
borne simply for display in pageants or at
funerals. For decorative purposes they
are most effective, and as they were anciently
borne by men of every degree down to
and including esquires, they might with
much advantage from the artistic standpoint
again be devised and brought into use.</p>

<p>A standard (fig. <a href="#Fig_139">139</a>) was a long narrow
flag with the lower edge horizontal, and the
upper gradually descending from the staff
to the extremity, which was split into two
rounded ends. A compartment next the
staff always contained the arms of St. George.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
The rest of the ground not infrequently was
formed of two, three, or four horizontal
stripes of the livery colours of the owner,
and divided into three sections by two
slanting bands with his word, reason, or
motto. Upon the section next to the St.
George's cross was generally displayed the
principal beast or other device of the bearer
and in later times the crest on a torse, while
the other sections and the field in general
were powdered with badges or rebuses.
The whole was fringed of the livery
colours.</p>

<p>The series illustrated in the volume in
the De Walden Library on "Banners,
Standards, and Badges from a Tudor Manuscript
in the College of Arms" will supply
ample evidence of the playful composition
of ancient standards, and hints as to
the way in which they may be invented
nowadays.</p>

<p>Pennons were small and narrow flags of
varying length, sometimes pointed, sometimes
swallow-tailed at the end, fixed below
the point of a lance or spear and carried by
the owner as his personal ensign (fig. <a href="#Fig_140">140</a>).
That held by Sir John d'Abernoun in his
well-known brass (<i>c.</i> 1277) at Stoke d'Abernoun
is short and pointed and fringed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
bears his arms (<i>azure a cheveron gold</i>). A
contemporary illustration of a large and
more fluttering form of pennon is to be
seen in fig. <a href="#Fig_141">141</a>. An example of a pennon
charged with a badge, in the shape of the
Percy crescent, occurs on the seal of Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a><br /><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>

<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
it was not unusual to set up on gables,
pinnacles, and other high places figures of
animals holding banners as vanes or ornaments.
Heraldic beasts as finials began to
be used even in the thirteenth century,
and an example so early as 1237 is noted
on the Pipe Roll of 22 Henry III, when a
charge occurs 'for making and setting up
a certain lion of stone upon the gable of
the King's hall'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> within the castle of
Windsor. Examples of the fourteenth
century are hard to find, but in the
fifteenth century and first half of the
sixteenth they are common enough. In
most of these later examples the creatures
sit up and support shields with arms or
badges; some, like the fine groups at
Mapperton in Dorset, once held vanes
as well.</p>

<p>Early vanes from their tendency to
decay are rare. In 1352-3 14s. were
spent 'upon a vane of copper painted
with the king's arms, bought to be put
upon the top of the hall of the king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
college'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in Windsor castle; and a delightful
example, also of copper, pierced with the
arms of Sir William Etchingham, its builder
(<i>ob.</i> 1389), still surmounts the steeple of
Etchingham church in Sussex (fig. <a href="#Fig_142">142</a>).
A simple specimen of an iron vane may yet
be seen on Cowdray House in the same
county. The octagonal steeple of Fotheringay
church, Northants, built at the cost
of Richard duke of York <i>c.</i> 1435, is surmounted
by a fine representation in copper
of his badge, the falcon within a fetterlock.</p>

<p>The employment of a creature to hold
up a banner of arms was already no novelty
in the fifteenth century, and examples have
been noted above of those on the tomb of
Lewis lord Bourchier (<i>ob.</i> 1431) and on
the seal of Margaret lady Hungerford
(<i>c.</i> 1460); to which may be added the banner-bearing
lion on the seal (<i>c.</i> 1442) of Henry
Percy, eldest son of Henry second earl
of Northumberland. The conversion
therefore of the sitting beast into a vane-holder
came about quite naturally. A
good instance of the end of the fifteenth
century forms a charming finial to the well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a><br /><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>known
kitchen at Stanton Harcourt in
Oxfordshire, but the griffin which sits aloft
there has, alas, no longer a vane to hold
(fig. <a href="#Fig_143">143</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_143"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 143.</span> Vane formerly upon the finial of

</div>

<p>Quite an array of such vane-holders was
set up early in the sixteenth century upon
the pinnacles of the nave clerestory of St.
George's chapel in Windsor castle, and
the contract made in 1506 for completing
the quire in like fashion provides for 'as
well the vautte within furth as archebotens,
crestys, corses, and the King's bestes
stondyng on theym to bere the fanes on
the outside of the said quere, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
creasts, corses (and) beasts above on the
outsides of Maister John Shornes Chappell.'
The contract made in 1511 for finishing
the adjacent Lady chapel also includes
'making up crests, corses, and the King's
bestes stondyng on theym to bere furth
squychons with armes.' These beasts
holding their glittering vanes seem to have
been completed only so far as the great
chapel was concerned, and are plainly
shown in Hollar's engraving of the building;
but they were all taken down in 1682
by the advice of Sir Christopher Wren,
who suggested that pineapples be set up in
their stead!</p>

<p>Another mention of figures with vanes
occurs in the contract made in 1546 for
the building of the Coventry cross:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>And further to set on every principall
pinnacle in the lowest story of the same
new Crosse, the Ymage or a Beast or a
foule, holding up a fane, and on everie
principall pinnacle in the second story
the image of a naked boy with a Targett,
and holding a Fane.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p></div>

<p>These beasts, fowls, and boys obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
performed a double duty, like the creatures
on Mapperton manor-house.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the 'King's bestes'
at Windsor and elsewhere is illustrated by
the accounts for the building of the great
hall of Hampton Court in 1533-4. These
include payments 'for the workyng and
makyng of a lyon and a dragon in stone,
standyng at the Gabull ends of the said
hall'; 'for two pynnys of irne for stayes
for the two bests of freston, standyng
at the gabyll endes of the haull'; and
'for gylding and payntyng of two vanys,
servyng the bests of freston stondyng at

Kynges armys, the other of the Quenys,
wrowghte wyth fyne golde and in owyle.'
Further payments are 'for makyng of 29
of the Kynges bestes to stand upon the
new batilments of the Kynges New Hall,
and uppon the femerell of the said Hall'
and 'for 16 vanys for the bestes standyng
upon the battylment of the hall.' Also
'for the payntyng of 6 great lyons, standyng
abowght the bartyllment, of tymber worke,
uppon the Kynges New Hall, theyre vaynys

the painting 'of 4 great dragons &amp; of 6
grewhounds servyng the same barttylment.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>There are also payments to a 'Karver,
for karvyng and coutting of 2 grewhondes,
oon lybert, servyng to stande uppon the
typpis of the vycys abowght the Kynges

<p>The free use of external colouring should
be noted.</p>

<p>The use of the King's beasts as heraldic
adjuncts was not confined at Hampton
Court to the building only, but they were
made to do duty, in an equally delightful
manner, as garden decorations. Thus
the payments already quoted include

<p>Before finally leaving the subject of
banners, a few remarks may be offered
touching our beautiful national banner
which we call the Union Jack.</p>

<p>This charming and interesting composition
is not only, in a large number of
cases when it is flown, displayed upside
down, but in a still greater number of
instances it is made quite incorrectly.</p>

<p>The first Union Jack, that in use from
1606 to 1801, combining as it did only
the cross of St. George for England and
the saltire of St. Andrew for Scotland,
presented little difficulty, since there was
practically no excuse for not drawing the
St. Andrew's cross straight through from
corner to corner. But the present Union
Jack is a much more difficult banner to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
draw, as well as to understand, and the
prevailing ignorance of its history even
among so-called 'educated' people is
extraordinary.</p>

<p>The Union Jack consists actually of (i)
the banner of St. George with its white
field reduced to a narrow edging on all
sides of the red cross, to enable it to be
superposed, without breaking the heraldic
rule of colour upon colour, upon (ii) the
blue banner of St. Andrew with his white
cross; but since the Union with Ireland
there has been combined with these (iii)
the banner of St. Patrick, which has a red
saltire upon a white field. This combination,
in order to meet Scottish susceptibilities,
has been effected in a very peculiar
but ingenious way, first by treating the
Irish banner like that of England, and
reducing its white field to a narrow edging
about the saltire, and then by slitting this
down the middle of each arm, and joining
the pieces to the opposite sides of St.
Andrew's saltire similarly treated, yet so
that the Scottish pieces are uppermost next
the staff. It thus comes about that whatever
be the shape of the flag, whether
square or oblong, two straight lines drawn
across it diagonally from corner to corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
should always equally divide the Scottish
and Irish crosses, and if this cannot be done
the flag is not correctly built up (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXXI">XXXI</a></span>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="PLATE_XXXI"></a>
<a href="images/i_168.jpg"><img src="images/i_168_tn.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt=""
title="Link to larger image of PLATE XXXI" /></a>
<div class="caption"><p class="center">PLATE XXXI. RIGHT AND WRONG VERSIONS OF THE UNION JACK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It also happens that unless the flag is
exactly square the blue sections of the field
must differ more or less in size. Ignorant
flag-makers try to correct this, but only by
dislocating in the middle the diagonal lines
that ought always to be straight and continuous.</p>

<p>The right way up of a Union Jack is
indicated by the Scottish, that is, the broader
white, half of the diagonal members being
always uppermost in the two pieces next
the staff.</p>

Drawing; Mottoes; Use and Misuse of the

<p>In gathering up for practical consideration
some of the points already discussed, as
well as others that are suggested by them,
something may first be said on the ways of
combining the arms of husband and wife.
This was done originally by simply setting
them side by side, a plan which of course
may still be followed whenever it is thought
desirable.</p>

<p>For a short time during the latter part
of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth
century the arms of husband and
wife were combined in one shield by the
curious device of halving or 'dimidiating'
them, by joining the half of the one to the
opposite half of the other, as in the arms of
Aymer of Valence and Mary de Seynt Pol,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
still borne (since 1347) by the lady's foundation
of Pembroke college at Cambridge.
Owing however to the many inconveniences
which this plan involved, it was soon exchanged
for the more simple way of
'impaling' or placing the entire arms of
both parties side by side in one shield
(fig. <a href="#Fig_146">146</a> and pls. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_VIII">VIII</a> C</span>, <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XVIII">XVIII</a> A, B</span>), a
practice that has continued ever since,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
except when the wife is an heiress. In
that case the lady's arms are usually drawn
upon a smaller shield and placed upon the
middle of the husband's arms (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_V">V</a> A</span>).
This ugly and most inconvenient plan,
though of considerable antiquity, might
very well be amended by the more ancient
way of quartering the arms together, as is
still done by the children of the heiress.
For rules for the combination of the arms of
a husband who has married two or more
wives, or the cumbrous regulations as to
quartering, the student may, if he wishes,
consult the various manuals of heraldry.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 146.</span> Shield of Bryen impaling Bures,

</div>

<p>When a man is a member of any Order,
such as the Garter or the Bath, only his
own arms should be encircled by the insignia
of the Order. Exceptions to this
rule can of course be found, but it is otherwise
a general one that ought strictly to be
followed. Bishops are entitled to bear
their personal arms only impaled with
those of their bishopstool or cathedral
church, and the same rule applies to deans,
heads of colleges, and regius professors
(like those at Cambridge) who have official
arms. The chancellor of a University
presumably may impale its arms with his
own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>It has already been shown that the arms
of ladies, all through the medieval period,
were borne in precisely the same way as their
fathers' or their husbands', that is, upon
a shield, lozenge, or roundel, and that the
present inconvenient restriction to a lozenge
did not come into use much before the
middle of the sixteenth century, when
heraldry and heraldic art were already
on the down-grade. The present custom
seems to be for the arms of married ladies
to be borne upon shields, and of widows
and spinsters upon lozenges. From the
artistic standpoint it would certainly be
desirable, whenever it is thought advisable,
to revert to the freedom of pre-Elizabethan
times.</p>

<p>Enough has already been said as to the
elasticity of drawing shields, helms, crests,
and mantlings, and as to the proper use of
supporters, but a few words may be added
as to the proper way of drawing the various
creatures that are used in heraldry.</p>

<p>Since heraldry is a survival of what was
once a living thing, it is clear that if modern
work is to look well, animals and birds ought
to be drawn in a more or less conventional
manner (figs. <a href="#Fig_148">148</a>, <a href="#Fig_149">149</a>). Some, such as
elephants, dogs, falcons, etc. may be drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
almost directly from nature; but others, especially
lions, if so represented, would manifestly
be unfit to consort with the leopards,
the wivers, the griffins, the two-headed
eagles, and other delightful creatures of
the early heralds which they borrowed from
the bestiaries. The conventional treatment
should not, however, be carried to excess,
nor should natural forms be too closely
copied. Here, as in other matters connected
with heraldry, a comparative study
of good ancient examples will soon show
what are the best types to follow.</p>

</div>

<p>It would be an advantage, too, if artists
would revert to the old ways of representing
the furs known as ermine and vair.
The ancient ermine tails did more or less
resemble the actual tail of an ermine, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a><br /><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the modern object with its three dots above
has no likeness to it whatever (fig. <a href="#Fig_150">150</a>).
So too with regard to vair, which represents
the skins of grey squirrels, the modern
treatment of it as rows of angular eighteenth
century shields is far removed from the conventional
forms of the real skins seen in the
best old work (fig. <a href="#Fig_151">151</a>).</p>

<p>It has already been pointed out that
there are no strict rules as to the particular
shades of colour allowable in heraldry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
it is one of the surprises of the student to
find what dull and cold tones were anciently
used that yet look quite right. The apparently
bright reds, for example, of the
enamel in the early stall-plates at Windsor
are actually brick-colour, and the apparent
fine blues a cold grey; but their combination
with gilding and silvering makes all
the difference in the ultimate beautiful rich
effect.</p>

<p>One thing that ought to be most
scrupulously avoided in all modern heraldic
decoration is the indicating of the gilding
and colouring by the pernicious 'dot-and-dash'
system. This is all very well as a
kind of shorthand in one's own notes or
memoranda, but it is utterly destructive of
artistic effect if applied in actual work.
Ancient shields in relief were no doubt
invariably painted, like those still to be
seen behind the quire at Westminster; but
let any one try to imagine the fine series at
York or St. Albans scored and pecked to
indicate the colour and gilding. If the
heraldic carvings are not to be painted,
at any rate do not let their surfaces be
disfigured. They may always be relieved
by diapering.</p>

<p>The treatment of mottoes may not, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
first sight, seem to fall within the scope of
this work, but actually it is one of very
real importance. There is much to be said
for the theory that mottoes are derived
from the war cries of early times, and
hence their frequent association with the
crest worn upon the helm. Reference has
already been made to examples upon seals
and other authorities. The association of
a motto with a shield only was not common
anciently, and when it is so found it is
generally placed on a scroll, like the well-known
examples on the tomb of Edward
prince of Wales at Canterbury (fig. <a href="#Fig_85">85</a>).
In later times, when shields began to be encircled
by the Garter of the famous Order
(fig. <a href="#Fig_152">152</a>), mottoes were often arranged
about the shield in a similar way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_152"></a>
<img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="300" height="319" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 152.</span> The Garter, from the brass of Thomas
lord Camoys, K.G. at Trotton in Sussex.</p></div>
</div>

<p>There was however always this very
important and noteworthy difference and
distinction, that the buckled band now so
commonly used for mottoes was anciently
never allowed for any but the motto of
the Order of the Garter. Other mottoes
were written on a band which was fastened
in a different way, or merely disposed
Garter-wise round the shield.</p>

<p>The earliest known representation of the
Garter is on a singular lead or pewter medal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>lion
(fig. <a href="#Fig_153">153</a>) commemorative of Edward
prince of Wales, first Prince of the Order,
now in the British Museum. In this
the prince is kneeling bare-headed before
a personification of the Holy Trinity, with
his gloves on the ground before him, and
an angel standing behind him and holding
his crested helm. The whole is enclosed
by a buckled band inscribed <span class="blackletter">hony soyt ke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
mal y pense</span>, with a cloud overlapping
its upper margin, from which issues an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
angel holding down the prince's shield of
arms.</p>

Wales, now in the British Museum.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It has been customary from within a few
years of the foundation of the Order in
1348 for the Knights-Companions to encircle
their personal arms with the Garter.</p>

<p>In a wardrobe account of King Edward
III, from 14th February 1349-50 to 30th
September 1351, payments are entered for
the making 'of two pencells of sindon <i>de
Triple</i>, each having in the midst a Garter
of blue sindon with a shield within the
same Garter of the King's arms quartered,
and beaten throughout the field with eagles
of gold'; but representations of such a usage
are hard to find. A good early example
is afforded by the monumental brass at
Trotton in Sussex of Thomas lord Camoys
(<i>ob.</i> 1419) (fig. <a href="#Fig_154">154</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 307px;"><a id="Fig_154"></a>
<img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="307" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="caption-hanging"><span class="smcap">Fig. 154.</span> Shield of arms (<i>a chief and three roundels
on the chief</i>) encircled by the Garter, from the
brass of Thomas lord Camoys (<i>ob.</i> 1419).</p></div>
</div>

<p>In illustration of the care above referred
to of distinguishing the Garter motto from
any other, two concrete examples may be
cited: one on the brass at Constance of
Robert Hallam bishop of Salisbury (<i>ob.</i>
1416), where the King's arms are encircled
by the Garter, and the bishop's own arms
by an open scroll with a scripture (fig. <a href="#Fig_155">155</a>);
the other on the west porch of the cathedral
church of Norwich, where the arms of King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Henry VI have the Garter about them,
and the arms of the builder of the porch,
bishop William Alnwick (1426-36), are
surrounded by a scroll with his motto.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_155"></a>
<a href="images/i_177.jpg"><img src="images/i_177_tn.jpg" width="300" height="212" alt=""

<div class="caption"><p class="caption-hanging"><span class="smcap">Fig. 155.</span> Shields encircled by the Garter
and a scroll, from the brass of Bishop
Hallam (<i>ob.</i> 1416) at Constance.</p></div>
</div>

<p>This distinction was carefully borne in
mind when the insignia of British Orders,
other than that of the Garter, were devised,
and in every case their mottoes are displayed
on plain and not buckled bands. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
Albert Medal for Bravery, however, the
encircling motto has been most improperly
placed on a buckled band like the Garter,
and the people who supply 'heraldic
stationery' are notorious offenders in the
same direction.</p>

<p>The lettering of a motto must of course
depend upon the circumstances of its use.
Nothing looks so well as the so-called
'old-English' or small black-letter, especially
if the height of the words is as
nearly as possible the same as the width of
the band or scroll, and the capitals are not
unduly prominent; but the form of capital
known as Lombardic is always preferable
to those of the black-letter alphabet. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a><br /><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
capitals alone are used, fanciful types should
be avoided; a good Roman form such as
is often found in Tudor inscriptions being
far better. If the motto to be set about a
shield is a short one it can often be extended
conveniently, if necessary, by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
judicious use of ornamental devices like
roses or other flowers between the words.
The ends of scrolls with mottoes have a
more satisfactory appearance if shown partly
curled up and partly pulled out spirally
than if forked and waved, as may so often
be seen nowadays. Scrolls always look
better if not bordered or edged in any way,
but this does not apply to the narrow bounding
line that may be necessary in enamelled
work.</p>

<p>At the present day it is the habit of divers
ladies of rank to surmount their hair, when
occasion allows, with diamond tiaras of
surpassing splendour. The ladies of olden
time were not free from a similar weakness,
but the diamond mines of South Africa
being then unknown, and other gems too
costly, they encouraged the goldsmiths to
make them beautiful crowns and crestings,
with which they adorned their heads and
headgear. A reference to the accurate
drawings and details published by Stothard
in his <i>Monumental Effigies</i> will show not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the high artistic excellence of these ornaments,
but also how becoming they were
to the ladies who wore them. They varied
greatly in design, from the simple circlet
of fleurons and trefoils of Queen Eleanor
of Castile (fig. <a href="#Fig_158">158</a>) to the sumptuous piece
of jewellery beset with pearls and stones,
which is represented on the alabaster effigy
of Queen Joan at Canterbury (fig. <a href="#Fig_159">159</a>)
and reflects so worthily the yet more
splendid crown of her husband, King
Henry IV (fig. <a href="#Fig_173">173</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Attention has already been drawn to the
decorative use of crowns in heraldry, and
a reference promised to the coronets of
peers and peeresses.</p>

<p>Coronets, as they are now called, originated
as early as 1343, when Edward duke
of Cornwall and earl of Chester was created
Prince of Wales, and invested by his father
with a circlet (<i>sertum</i>) on his head, a gold
ring on his finger, and a golden verge which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
was placed in his hand. The circlet in
question passed into the possession of his
brother, Lionel duke of Clarence, who in
1388 left in his will 'a golden circlet with
which my brother and lord was created
prince' as well as 'that circlet with which
I was created duke.' This latter event
happened in 1362, at the same time that his
brother John of Gaunt was created duke
of Lancaster, when King Edward girded
his son with a sword and put upon his
head a fur cap and over it 'un cercle d'or
et de peres,' a circlet of gold and precious
stones. This investiture with a coronet
was for some time restricted to dukes, but
in 1385 King Richard II bestowed upon
Richard earl of Oxford the new dignity of
marquess of Dublin, and invested him with
a sword and a circlet of gold.</p>

<p>The investing of an earl with a coronet
does not seem to have become customary
before the reign of Edward VI, but earls
had worn coronets in virtue of their rank
for a long time previously. In April 1444,
when Henry Beauchamp earl of Warwick
was created premier earl by Henry VI, the
letters patent of his appointment empower
him 'to wear a golden circlet upon his
head and his heirs male to do the same on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
feast days in all places where it is convenient
as well in our presence as of others.' But
the practice can perhaps be carried still
further back, for Selden in his <i>Titles of
Honour</i> (p. 680) quotes a receipt dated
1319 by William of Lavenham, treasurer
of Aymer of Valence earl of Pembroke, of
'a gold crown of the said earl.'</p>

<p>By his will dated 1375 Richard FitzAlan
earl of Arundel leaves to Richard his son
'my best crown (<i>ma melieure coroune</i>)
charging him upon my blessing that he part
not with it during his life, and that after
his death he leave it to his heir in the same
manner to descend perpetually from heir
to heir to the lords of Arundel in remembrance
of me and of my soul.' He also
leaves to his daughter Joan 'my second-best
crown' and to his daughter Alice 'my
third crown,' under similar conditions. The
earl's best crown may be that shown upon
the alabaster effigy at Arundel of his grandson
Thomas earl of Arundel; to whom it was
bequeathed by his father (fig. <a href="#Fig_163">163</a>). It has
alternate leaves and pearled spikes, similar
to, but richer and better in design than, the
earls' coronets of to-day. Sir N. H. Nicolas
suggests that earl Richard's second and third
coronets were bequeathed to his daughters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
because both were countesses; Joan being
wife to Humphrey Bohun earl of Hereford,
and Alice to Thomas Holand earl of Kent.</p>

<p>There are other bequests of coronets to
ladies: Edmund Mortimer earl of March
and Ulster left in 1380 to his daughter
Philippa, afterwards wife to (1) John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Hastings earl of Pembroke, (2) Richard
earl of Arundel, and (3) John lord St. John,
'a coronal of gold with stones and two
hundred great pearls (<i>un coronal a'or ove
perie et deuz cents grands perles</i>) and also a
circlet with roses, with emeralds and rubies
or Alexandria in the roses (<i>un cercle ove
roses emeraudes et rubies d'alisaundre en les
roses</i>).' Michael de la Pole earl of Suffolk
also left in 1415 to his wife Katherine the
diadem or coronet which had belonged to
her father Hugh earl of Stafford, who died
in 1386.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>The swan's head crest of Richard Beauchamp
earl of Warwick (<i>ob.</i> 1439) on his
effigy at Warwick is encircled by a crown of
stalked pearls, not unlike those of an earl's
coronet of the present day (fig. <a href="#Fig_160">160</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><a id="Fig_160"></a>

Beauchamp, earl of Warwick (<i>ob.</i> 1439,) from his
gilt-latten effigy at Warwick.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Among Stothard's engravings are two of
effigies of quite early date of ladies wearing
crowns or coronets. One, at Scarcliffe in
Derbyshire (fig. <a href="#Fig_161">161</a>), cannot be later than
about 1250, and the crown in this case is
composed of some twenty simple leaves set
upright upon the edge of a narrow band.
The other, at Staindrop in Durham, is about
a century later, and represents a widowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
lady, probably Margery, second wife of
John lord Nevill, wearing a crown of curled
leaves with points between (fig. <a href="#Fig_162">162</a>). The
next illustration is of special interest since
it represents Thomas earl of Arundel (<i>ob.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
1416) wearing presumably the coronet
mentioned above in his grandfather's bequest
(fig. <a href="#Fig_163">163</a>); his countess Beatrice has a
slighter coronet of similar character. The
great alabaster tomb, also at Staindrop, or
Ralph earl of Westmorland (<i>ob.</i> 1425) and
his two countesses furnishes the next
example. In this case the earl is in armour,
but both ladies wear delicate coronets,
formed of rows of points with triplets of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
pearls and intervening single pearls, rising
from narrow ornamental circlets (fig. <a href="#Fig_164">164</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The tomb of another earl of Arundel,
William FitzAlan (<i>ob.</i> 1487), and of his
countess Joan, further illustrates the use
of coronets. The earl's coronet is in this
case composed of a continuous row of leaves
with a jewelled band (fig. <a href="#Fig_165">165</a>); the countess
wears a similar coronet, but curiously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
distorted behind, evidently because it was
thought to be more becoming when so worn
(fig. <a href="#Fig_166">166</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The monument in St. Peter's church,
in Sheffield, of George earl of Shrewsbury
(<i>ob.</i> 1538) and his two wives represents
him in armour, with the mantle and collar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of the Garter, and a coronet, now broken,
about his head. His wives also have
coronets, which are happily complete, and
are composed of continuous series of twelve
short points tipped with pearls. The earl's
coronet seems to have had similar points,
but with sixteen pearls instead of twelve.</p>

<p>The effigy <i>circa</i> 1500 at Whitchurch
in Salop of that famous warrior, John
Talbot earl of Shrewsbury, who was killed
in 1453, also represents him in the mantle
of the Garter over his armour and a coronet
about his head. This is unfortunately
badly broken, but seems to have resembled
that on the Sheffield figures.</p>

<p>Besides these examples of coronets of
earls and their countesses a few illustrations
of those worn by dukes and duchesses
may be cited.</p>

<p>It has been already noted that the shields
on the monument of Humphrey duke of
Gloucester (<i>ob.</i> 1446) at St. Albans are
surmounted alternately by crested helms
and by caps with coronets. These coronets
have a richly jewelled circlet on which is set,
instead of leaves, a series of what seem to
be cups full of daisies, with small triplets
of pearls between.</p>

<p>Another good coronet is to be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
on the effigy of Thomas Holand duke of
Exeter (<i>ob.</i> 1447) on the monument
formerly in St. Katharine's hospital by the
Tower, now in the chapel in Regent's
Park. The duke's coronet here is quite
narrow, and composed of some eighteen or
twenty trefoils set close upon a band (fig.
<a href="#Fig_167">167</a>); but his two duchesses have coronets
of triplets of pearls with intermediate
single pearls, like those of the countesses of
Westmorland at Staindrop (fig. <a href="#Fig_168">168</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The alabaster effigy at Ewelme of Alice,
widow of William duke of Suffolk (<i>ob.</i>
1450), shows her in a beautiful coronet of
fleurs-de-lis alternating with small clusters
of pearls (fig. <a href="#Fig_169">169</a>), and similar coronets once
adorned the effigies at Wingfield in Suffolk
of her son John de la Pole duke of Suffolk
(<i>ob.</i> 1491) and his wife Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_169"></a>

</div>

<p>The privilege of wearing coronets was
not extended to viscounts until the reign
of James I, and to barons until 1661.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>The official patterns of coronets to which
peers and peeresses are now restricted have,
as may be seen from the examples above
cited, practically no relation to the older
forms, which exhibited the usual delightful
medieval elasticity of design.</p>

<p>The present coronets too are rendered
uglier than ever by the modern rule forbidding
them to be jewelled in any way.
This was not formerly the case. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
the stuff remaining in the palace of Westminster
in 1553, and delivered to lady
Jane Grey, was 'a coronet for a duke, set
with five roses of diamonds, six small
pointed diamonds, one table emerald, six
great ballases, seven blue sapphires, and
thirty-eight great pearls, with a cap of crimson
velvet and a roll of powdered armyns
about the same'; and a beautifully ornamented
coronet of much earlier date than
the painting is shown in a portrait of John
marquess of Winchester, the defender of
Basing House, who died in 1674.</p>

<p>It is the custom now for ladies of rank
to wear their coronets only at coronations,
and to display them on their note-paper,
their spoons and forks, and on the panels
of their carriages and motor-cars. Such
coronets cannot however be considered
artistic objects, even when depicted apart
from the crimson velvet bonnets which
they encircle, and there is no reason why
ladies should not devise and wear coronet-like
ornaments of their own invention.</p>

<p>A little research will show that crowns
of every form and fashion have always
been freely used in heraldic decoration,
both by themselves and as ensigning
letters or other devices, and so long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a><br /><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a><br /><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
care be taken not to infringe what may be
called official patterns, there are really no
limits to a continuance of the ancient
practice.</p>

<p>The lady Margaret Beaufort, countess
of Richmond and mother of King Henry
VII, has left us a delightful series of
coronets. First, on a seal newly made
for her on the accession of her son, her
shield of arms is ensigned with a coronet
or crown of roses and fleurs-de-lis placed
alternately along the edge of a narrow band
(pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXX">XXX</a></span>). Shortly after 1505 the lady
Margaret began to build Christ's College at
Cambridge, and both the gatehouse (fig.
<a href="#Fig_170">170</a>) and the oriel of the master's lodge
(fig. <a href="#Fig_171">171</a>) are rich in heraldic decoration.
In this case both her arms and her
portcullis badge are ensigned with coronets
set with a continuous row of triplets of
pearls.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In the lady Margaret's later
foundation of St. John's College, her arms,
etc. again are displayed upon the stately
gatehouse; in this case with a coronet of
roses and fleurs-de-lis over the shield, as in
her seal (fig. <a href="#Fig_172">172</a>). Her portcullis badge, on
the other hand, has over it a fine coronet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a><br /><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
formed of clusters of roses, which recalls
the circlet of roses set with emeralds and
rubies of Alexandria mentioned earlier in
this chapter. It is quite easy to conjure
up visions of coronets or circlets formed of
lilies or marguerites, or of roses red and
white, or of any other suitable flower or
device, wrought in gold or gilded silver,
and either jewelled or bright with enamel.
And let designers take heart when so
recent and yet so picturesque an object as
the so-called 'naval crown' can be produced,
with its cresting of sterns and square
sails of ships. This was used most effectively
some years ago as one of the decorations
encircling the Nelson Column in
London on Trafalgar Day.</p>

<p>It may be as well to point out that the
royal crown has been composed, from the
fifteenth century, of crosses alternating with
fleurs-de-lis, and since the coronation of
King Henry IV it has been distinguished
by being arched over cross-wise. The
splendid open crown shown on the effigy
of the king at Canterbury (fig. <a href="#Fig_173">173</a>) is
not that wherewith he was crowned, but
another worn with the parliament robes
in which he is represented. Beautiful
examples of crowns of simpler type are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
afforded by the effigies of King Henry III
(fig. <a href="#Fig_174">174</a>) and King Edward II (fig. <a href="#Fig_175">175</a>).
When the lady Elizabeth Wydville became
the queen of Edward IV, she ensigned her
arms with a beautiful crown or coronet of
alternate large crosses and fleurs-de-lis with
smaller fleurs-de-lis between, rising from a
richly jewelled band (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXV">XXV</a></span>), and a rich
example of the crown of King Henry VIII
so treated is to be seen on the great carved
panel with his arms, etc. at New Hall in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Essex (fig. <a href="#Fig_189">189</a>). Crosses and fleurs-de-lis
are now used only in the coronets of
those of royal blood.</p>

<p>From ornaments for the head it is easy
to pass to those for the neck.</p>

<p>The wearing about the neck of something
which was considered decorative or
becoming has been customary with the fair
sex in every part of the world and in all
ages of its history, and necklaces of every
form, material, and fashion are as popular
to-day as ever. But less attention is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
paid to the decorative collars that once were
worn not only by women but by men.</p>

<p>It has always been a mark of distinction
or dignity to wear about the neck a chain
or collar of gold, silver, or silver-gilt, either
as an ornament, or a decoration of honour,
or as a badge of partizanship; and the
most noteworthy of these to-day are the
collars of the various orders of Knighthood,
such as the Garter (fig. <a href="#Fig_177">177</a>), the Thistle,
and the Bath.</p>

</div>

<p>The history and characteristic features of
these are well known, and representations
of them abound; moreover the wearing of
them is confined to a few privileged persons.
It is therefore hardly necessary to discuss
them further in a work like the present.</p>

<p>The case is however different with
regard to the so-called livery collars, since
these may properly be regarded as models<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
for the formation and construction of such
similar collars as may freely be worn to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>The most notable of such decorations
during the medieval period was the collar
of SS which formed the distinctive cognisance
of the House of Lancaster (figs. <a href="#Fig_178">178</a>,
<a href="#Fig_179">179</a>). It was worn by persons of every
degree, from the King and Queen to the
knight and his esquire, and it was likewise
worn by their wives and even conferred on
civilians.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_178"></a>

in Sussex.</p>

<p class="center">2. From the brass of Sir William Calthorpe, 1420,

</div>
</div>

<p>The collar of SS was apparently invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
by King Henry IV before his accession,
and quite a number of important entries
that throw light upon its history occur in
his household accounts while he was only
Henry of Lancaster earl of Derby.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_179"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="caption-hanging"><span class="smcap">Fig. 179.</span> Collar of SS from the effigy of
William lord Bardolf (<i>ob.</i> 1441) at Dennington
in Suffolk.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In 1390-1 a gold signet was engraved
for him 'cum j plume et j coler,' of which
unhappily no impressions are known. In
1391-2 there was made for him a 'coler'
of gold 'with seventeen letters of S after
the manner of feathers with scrolls and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
scriptures in the same with a swan in the
tiret.' This recalls the badge upon one
of Henry's own seals as earl of Derby
(1385) described above (p. 167), an ostrich
plume entwined with a scroll and the
scripture <span class="blackletter">souvereyne</span> (pl. <span class="smcap"><a href="#PLATE_XXIV">XXIV</a> C</span>), and we
know from other sources of Henry's favour
towards the Bohun swan, which device he
used in right of his first wife, the lady
Mary Bohun. The collar of SS, moreover,
on the effigy of John Gower the poet (<i>ob.</i>
1402) in Southwark cathedral church has a
swan on the pendant of it, and no doubt
represents the collar actually given to him
by Henry of Lancaster in 1393-4. The
initial letter, too, of the charter granted to
the city of Gloucester by Henry as King in
1399, contains a crown encircled by a collar
of SS ending in two lockets between which
is a pendant charged with a swan. The
earl's accounts for 1393-4 mention the
purchase of the silver 'of a collar made
with rolled esses and given to Robert
Waterton because the lord had given the
collar of the same Robert to another
esquire.'</p>

<p>In 1396-7 a charge is entered 'for the
weight of a collar made, together with
esses, of flowers of <span class="blackletter">soveigne vous de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
moy</span><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> hanging and enamelled weighing
eight ounces.'</p>

<p>What these flowers were is uncertain.
Charges for making 'flores domini' occur
in 1390-1 and other years, and in 1391-2
three hundred leaves (?flowers) <i>de souveine
vous de moy</i> of silver-gilt were bought for
one of the earl's robes.</p>

<p>In 1407 Henry of Lancaster as King
ordered payment to be made to Christopher
Tildesley, citizen and goldsmith of
London, of the huge sum of £385 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>
'for a collar of gold worked with this word
<span class="blackletter">soveignez</span> and letters of S and X enamelled
and garnished with nine large
pearls, twelve large diamonds, eight balases,
and eight sapphires, together with a great
nouche in manner of a treangle with a
great ruby set in it and garnished with four
large pearls.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Most of these entries suggest that the
mysterious SS stand for <i>Soveignez</i>, and
possibly at one time this was the case, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Henry's seal as earl of Derby in 1385
containing the feathers with the scripture
<span class="blackletter">souvereyne</span> must not be overlooked.
There is moreover, on a fragment which
has fortunately survived in a tattered and
burnt mass of fragments of a jewel account
of Henry's reign in the Public Record
Office, the important entry of a payment
to Christopher Tildesley of 'a collar of
gold made for the King with twenty-four
letters of S pounced with <span class="blackletter">soverain</span>, and
four bars, two pendants, and a tiret with a
nouche garnished with a balas and six large
pearls (the balas bought of the said
Christopher for £10 and the price of the
pearls at 40<i>s.</i>, being £12) weighing 7 oz.
Troy at 23<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> £8 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> Also a black
tissue for the same collar 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> and for
the workmanship of it £4.'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The King's
word <span class="blackletter">soverayne</span> also occurs many times,
with the Queen's word <span class="blackletter">a temperance</span>, on
the tester over their monument at Canterbury,
which has likewise the shield of arms
for the King, the King and Queen, and the
Queen alone, encircled in each case with a
collar of SS with golden eagles placed upon
the tiret. Gold eagles also form stops between
the repetitions of the word <span class="blackletter">soverayne</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Another example of a collar of SS with
an eagle as a pendant is to be seen on the
monument of Oliver Groos, esquire (<i>ob.</i>
1439), in Sloley church, Norfolk (fig. <a href="#Fig_180">180</a>).</p>

<p>Examples of effigies in stone or brass of
men and women wearing the collar of SS
are common throughout the Lancastrian
period. The SS seem in most cases to be
represented as sewn or worked upon a band
of silk, velvet, or other stuff,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> which usually
ends in buckled lockets, linked by a trefoil-shaped
tiret, from which is hung a small
ring (fig. <a href="#Fig_181">181</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>Several other interesting occurrences of
the collar of SS may be noted. In one of
the windows in the chapter house at Wells
is a shield of the arms of Mortimer, and
next to it a gold star within the horns of a
crescent party blue and silver, encircled
by a collar of SS also half blue and
half white. As there are associated with
these the arms of the King and of Thomas
duke of Clarence (<i>ob.</i> 1421), they probably
commemorate Edmund Mortimer earl of
March, who died in 1425.</p>

<p>In 1449 a receipt given to the steward
of Southampton by the prior of the Shene
Charterhouse, which was founded by King
Henry V, bears a seal with <span class="blackletter">ihs</span> within a
collar of SS; and in St. Mary's church at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
Bury St. Edmunds the ceiling over the
tomb of John Baret, an ardent Lancastrian,
who died in 1480, is painted with collars
of SS surrounding his monogram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also in a MS. in the British
Museum,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> written probably for John lord
Lovel (<i>ob.</i> 1414), a painting of the arms of
Holand quartering Lovel surrounded by a
collar, one half of which is white and the
other half blue, with gold letters of SS,
having for a pendant a gold fetterlock,
party inside of red and black.</p>

<p>On a brass <i>c.</i> 1475 at Muggington
in Derbyshire the Beaufort portcullis
appears as a pendant to the collar of SS.</p>

<p>With the rise to power of the Yorkists
on the accession of Edward IV a rival collar
to that of the Lancastrian livery came into
vogue, composed of blazing suns and York
roses disposed alternately (fig. <a href="#Fig_182">182</a>). It
may be seen in various forms on a number
of monumental effigies and brasses, usually
with the couchant white lion of the house
of March as a pendant, but on the accession
of Richard III the lion was replaced by
his silver boar. On the wooden Nevill
effigies at Brancepeth the earl has a collar
of rayed suns with the boar pendant,
while the countess has a collar of alternate
suns and roses. Joan countess of Arundel,
on her effigy at Arundel (fig. <a href="#Fig_166">166</a>), shows
another variation by interpolating the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
FitzAlan oak leaves between the suns and
the roses.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>After the accession of Henry VII the
collar of SS was again revived, but with
variations and different pendants. The
effigy, for example, at Salisbury of Sir John
Cheyney, K.G. (<i>ob.</i> 1489), has appended to
his SS collar a large portcullis charged
with a rose. A collar of gold weighing
over 7 ounces is recorded to have been
given in 1499 to adorn the image of the
Holy Trinity in Norwich cathedral church,
and is described as containing twenty-five
letters of S, two tirets, two 'purcoles' (portcullises),
and one double R(?) with a red
rose enamelled.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> A similar collar, but all of
gold, is shown in the portrait of Sir Thomas
More, painted by Holbein in 1527 (fig. <a href="#Fig_183">183</a>).
On a brass <i>c.</i> 1510 at Little Bentley in Essex
the collar of SS has a portcullis pendant, and
on the Manners effigy (<i>c.</i> 1513) at Windsor
and the Vernon effigy (1537) at Tong
the pendant to the knight's collar is a large
double rose.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;"><a id="Fig_183"></a>

</div>

<p>The collars on the Salkeld effigies (1501)
at Salkeld in Cumberland are composed of
SS and four-leaved flowers alternately, and
that worn by Sir George Forster (<i>ob.</i> 1526)
on his tomb at Aldermaston in Berkshire is
of SS laid sideways and alternating with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
knots, and has a portcullis and rose pendant.
In 1545 Sir John Alen, sheriff in 1518 and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
lord mayor in 1525 and 1535, bequeathed
for the use of the lord mayor of London,
and his successors for ever, his collar of
SS, knots, and roses of red and white
enamel; and a cross of gold with precious
stones and pearls was given to be worn
with it in 1558. An effigy of a Lisle <i>c.</i>
1550 at Thruxton in Hants has a similar
collar of SS, knots, and roses, also with a
cross as a pendant. Sir John Alen's collar,
somewhat enlarged, and with a modern
'jewel' as a pendant, is still worn by the
lord mayor of London, and is the only
medieval collar of SS that has survived.</p>

<p>After the reign of King Henry VIII the
wearing of the collar of SS gradually
became restricted to judges and other
officials, and has so survived to the present
day, when it is still worn in England by
the lord chief justice, the kings-of-arms,
heralds, and pursuivants, and by the
serjeants-at-arms.</p>

<p>The lord chief justice's collar, like all
those formerly worn by the judges, is composed
of SS and knots; the others of SS
only.</p>

<p>Beside the livery collars above mentioned,
others have been worn from time to time.</p>

<p>In the exquisitely painted diptych or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Richard II and his avowries, now at Wilton
House, the King has about his neck a collar

is covered all over with similar collars enclosing
his favourite badge, the white hart.
A collar of gold 'de Bromecoddes' with a
sapphire and two pearls occurs in the great
inventory taken on the death of King
Henry V, and a collar formed of SS and
broom-cods was also made for King Henry
VI in July 1426.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>On his effigy at Ripon (<i>c.</i> 1390) Sir
Thomas Markenfield displays a collar
formed of park palings, which widen out
in front to enclose a couchant hart (fig. <a href="#Fig_184">184</a>).
If this were not a personal collar, it may
have been a livery of Henry of Lancaster
as earl of Derby.</p>

<p>A brass of the same date of a knight,
formerly at Mildenhall, showed him as
wearing a collar apparently once composed
of scrolls with scriptures, joining in front
upon a large crown with a collared dog or
other beast within it.</p>

<p>The brass at Wotton-under-Edge of
Thomas lord Berkeley (<i>ob.</i> 1417) shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>

<p>In his will dated 1430 William Stowe
the elder, of Ripon, a retainer in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
household of the earl of Northumberland,
bequeaths his silver livery <i>Anglice cressaunt</i>

shrine of St. Wilfrid.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Possibly the 'cressaunt'
was an object similar to that here
figured (now belonging to the duke of
Northumberland), and the collar like that
formed of <span class="blackletter">p's</span> and crescents enclosing <span class="blackletter">p's</span>
linked together which is engraved upon it
(fig. <a href="#Fig_186">186</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The earlier collars, as has already been
noted, were composed of devices sewn
upon a band of stuff, but in later examples
a more open treatment is found wherein
the devices are linked together by short
pieces of chain, as in the collar of SS
shown in Sir Thomas More's portrait.
The Yorkist collar of suns and roses on an
effigy at Erdington is so treated, as is the
collar of SS and flowers on the Salkeld
effigies, which may perhaps be a personal
and not a livery collar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>Collars of similar construction, but always
of silver, with pendent scutcheons of the
town arms, were worn by the little bands
of minstrels called waits, formerly in the
employ of most towns of importance (fig.
<a href="#Fig_187">187</a>).</p>

<p>In London the six waits appointed in 1475
had silver collars of SS with scutcheons of
the city arms. At Exeter the four waits'
collars, dating from about 1500, still exist,
and are formed of roundels with <span class="blackletter">X</span>'s and
<span class="blackletter">R's</span> alternately (fig. <a href="#Fig_187">187</a>). Two beautiful
waits' collars at Norwich (<i>c.</i> 1550) are composed
of silver castles and gilded leopards
alternately, like those in the appended shield
(fig. <a href="#Fig_187">187</a>). The waits' collars at Lynn were
formed of scrolled leaves alternating with
dragons' heads pierced with crosses, like
those in the town arms, which are allusive
of St. Margaret (fig. <a href="#Fig_187">187</a>). At York the
collars are formed wholly of little silver
leopards, and at Beverley of eagles and
beavers alternately. The waits' collars at
Bristol date from the reign of Queen Mary,
and are composed of pierced roundels containing
alternately the letters CB. and a rose
dimidiating a pomegranate.</p>

</div>

<p>The wearing of collars, or chains as they
are called, by mayors, mayoresses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a><br /><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
sheriffs is comparatively modern. It was
formerly the custom for every person of
any dignity to wear a chain, and it was
only when chains began to go out of
fashion that the wearing of them survived
among persons of particular dignity such
as mayors and sheriffs.</p>

<p>The collar of SS worn by the lord mayor
of London is an exceptional example, and
the only other early mayor's chain is that
given to Kingston-on-Hull in 1564 and
remade in 1570. A plain gold chain was
bequeathed to the city of York in 1612,
and 'a fayre chayne of gold double
linked with a medall of massy gold' was
given to the town of Guildford in 1673.
In 1716 a gold chain for the mayor was
given to the city of Norwich, but passed
on for the use of the deputy mayor on a
new chain being given in 1757. Yarmouth
bought itself a chain in 1734, and seven
other towns became possessed of mayors'
chains towards the end of the eighteenth
century. Down to 1850 some fifteen more
mayors' chains came into existence, mostly
of simple type, like the older chains, with
one or more rows of plain or ornate links.
Since 1850 practically every town that can
boast of a corporation has likewise got a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
chain for its mayor, and appalling creations
many of them are, with rows of tablet links,
and armorial pendants as large as saucers.</p>

<p>A simple gold chain to be worn by the
sheriffs of Norwich was given in 1739, but
those at Chester, Newcastle, Exeter, and
other places are quite recent. In London
it has been the custom for the friends and
admirers of the sheriffs to present them with
elaborate gold collars on their accession to
office, but these are happily private property
and not official insignia. The same description
applies to them as to the recent mayors'
chains.</p>

<p>Chains for mayoresses have not yet become
general, but they are being multiplied
yearly. The mayoress of Kingston-on-Hull
had an official chain as early as 1604,
but it was sold as being 'useless' in 1835.
The lady mayoress of York has a chain of
plain gold links given in 1670, which is
regularly weighed on its delivery to and return
by the wearer. All other mayoresses'
chains are quite recent, and in most cases
of the same fearsome design as those worn
by their husbands.</p>

<p>The unfortunate mayors, mayoresses,
and sheriffs are practically at the mercy of
ignorant and inartistic tradesmen for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
designing and making of the collars they
are called upon to wear officially, but that
is no reason why people with more enlightened
ideas should not invent, design,
and wear collars or chains that are beautiful
in themselves. The examples already
quoted and the many illustrations of others
that are accessible will show what comely
ornaments the old heraldic collars were,
and many a lady would look well in a
collar to whom a necklace is most unbecoming.
Flowers, letters, and devices of
heraldic import can easily be embroidered
in gold, or struck out of metal and
enamelled, and then be sewn down on
velvet or silk stuff, or linked together by
fine chains.</p>

<p>But let every wearer of a chain or collar
avoid the error of making it too long.
The ancient collars were quite short, and
therefore rested comfortably and easily
upon the shoulders. Official collars have
however grown to so preposterous a length
that they have to be tied with bows of
ribbons upon the shoulders to hinder them
from slipping off the wearer altogether!
The reason of this is curious and instructive.
The old collars were, as aforesaid, of
sensible dimensions, but the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
of wigs in the seventeenth century necessitated
the collars being lengthened to be
worn outside them. Wigs had their day
and at last disappeared from general wear,
but the lengthened collars remain, and it
has not occurred to any one in authority
that they might now advantageously be
shortened. So the inconvenience goes on.</p>

<br />
<small>HERALDIC EMBROIDERIES</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The introduction of armorial insignia in embroidered
Vestments: on Robes: on Beds, etc.</p></div>


<p>No one who has had occasion to examine
any series of old wills and inventories,
especially those of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, can fail to have noticed
what a large part was played by heraldry
in the household effects of our forefathers.
In the vestments and other ornaments of
the chapel, the hallings, bankers, and
like furniture of the hall, the hangings and
curtains of the beds and bedchambers, the
gold and silver vessels and utensils of the
table, or in carpets and cushions and footstools,
shields of arms, badges, mottoes,
and quasi-heraldic devices of all sorts were
as common as blackberries in autumn.</p>

<p>And the evidence of illuminated pictures
and monumental effigies is equally strong
in showing that heraldry was quite as much
in vogue for personal adornment.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact heraldry had its very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a><br /><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
origin in a system of devices to be worn on
shields and banners and coats-of-arms
to distinguish the wearer in battle, and
from the coat-of-arms of the knight it was
but a step to the armorial gown or mantle
of his lady.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_188"></a>
<a href="images/i_211.jpg"><img src="images/i_211_tn.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt=""

<div class="caption"><p class="caption-hanging"><span class="smcap">Fig. 188</span>. Part of an embroidered altar frontal with a
rebus at Baunton in Gloucestershire: date, late fifteenth

</div>

<p>It would be somewhat tedious to extract
from the authorities just cited, especially
since they are easily accessible, every entry
relating to an heraldic ornament or piece
of furniture. But with regard to hangings
and embroideries the case is somewhat
different, inasmuch as numbers of ladies
are engaged nowadays in stitch-work of
every kind, amongst which heraldic embroidery
ought certainly to have a place.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the inventories of
Church stuffs furnish us with some of the
earliest examples of heraldic embroideries,
and often in sufficiently precise terms to
enable us to realize what the things looked
like.</p>

<p>Thus an inventory taken in 1315 of the
ornaments at Christchurch, Canterbury,
enumerates such things as a chasuble and
five copes, the gift of Katharine Lovel,
sewn with arms of divers persons; a
white cope of the arms of the King of
Scotland; a cope of Peter bishop of Exeter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
(<i>ob.</i> 1291) of baudekyn 'with biparted
shields' (an early example); a cope of
John of Alderby bishop of Lincoln, and
another of Thomas Burton bishop of
Exeter, of green cloth embroidered with
shields; an albe with apparels of blue
velvet embroidered with shields and fleurs-de-lis;
two albes sewn with shields and
black letters, and a third of red samite
embroidered with shields and popinjays;
an albe sewn with lozenges with the arms
of the King of England and of Leybourne;
an albe sewn with shields and embroidered
with letters; an albe sewn with the arms
of Northwood and Poynyngs in quadrangles;
and an albe, stole, and fanon sewn
with divers arms in lozenges with purple
frets. The same inventory mentions a
vestment of Philip King of France, made,
quite properly, of blue cloth with fleurs-de-lis;
and a number of vestments with
orphreys of the arms of the King of England
and of France.</p>

<p>The inventory of the vestry of Westminster
Abbey taken in 1388 also contains
some interesting heraldic ornaments, such
as a frontal with the arms of England and
France in red and blue velvet woven with
golden leopards and fleurs-de-lis, from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
burial of King Edward III; six murrey
carpets woven with the new arms of the
King of England and of the count of
Hainault (in other words, the quartered
shield adopted by Edward III in 1340,
and the arms of his queen, Philippa of
Hainault); four carpets of the arms of
the earl of Pembroke; four carpets of red
colour woven with white shields having
three red fleurs-de-lis, of the gift of Richard
Twyford, whose arms they were; five
black carpets having in the corners shields
of the arms of St. Peter and St. Edward;
two green silk cloths sewn with the arms
of England, Spain, and Queen Eleanor; a
bed with a border with the arms of the
King of Scotland; three new copes of a
red colour of noble cloth of gold damask,
with orphreys of black velvet embroidered
with the letters T and A and swans of
pearl, the gift of Thomas duke of Gloucester,
whose wife was Eleanor Bohun, and her
family badge a white swan; a cope of red
velvet with gold leopards and a border of
blue velvet woven with gold fleurs-de-lis,
formerly the lord John of Eltham's, whose
fine alabaster tomb in the abbey church has
the same arms on his shield.</p>

<p>A St. Paul's inventory of 1402 also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
contains a few choice examples: a cope of
red velvet with gold lions, and orphreys of
the collars of the duke of Lancaster and a
stag lying in the middle of each collar; a
suit of blue cloth of gold powdered with
gold crowns in each of which are fixed two
ostrich feathers; six copes of red cloth of
gold with blue orphreys with golden-hooded
falcons and the arms of Queen
Anne of Bohemia; three albes and amices
of linen cloth with orphreys of red velvet
powdered and worked with little angels
and the arms of England, given by Queen
Isabel; three albes and amices with apparels
of red cloth of gold powdered with divers
white letters of S and with golden leopards,
given by John of Gaunt; two great cushions
of silk cloth of blue colour with a white
cross throughout, and in each quarter of
the cross the golden head of a lion.</p>

<p>The secular documents carry on the
story.</p>

<p>Some quite noteworthy items may be
found in the account of the expenses of the
great wardrobe of King Edward III (1345-48-9):
for making a bed of blue taffata
for the King powdered with garters containing
this word <span class="blackletter">hony soit q mal y
pense</span>; for making a jupe of blue taffata for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the King's body with Garters and buckles
and pendants of silver-gilt; for making 40
clouds for divers of the King's garments,
embroidered with gold, silver, and silk,
with an <span class="blackletter">E</span> in the middle of gold, garnished
with stars throughout the field; for making
six pennons for trumpets and clarions
against Christmas Day of sindon beaten
with the King's arms quarterly; for making
of a bed of red worsted given to the lord
King by Thomas de Colley powdered with
silver bottles having tawny bands and
curtains of sindon beaten with white bottles;
for making a harness for the lord David
King of Scotland of 'blu' velvet with a
pale of red velvet and within the pale
aforesaid a white rose; for making a harness
of white bokeram for the King
stencilled with silver, namely, a tunic and
shield wrought with the King's word <span class="blackletter">hay
hay the wythe swan; by godes soule I
am thy man</span> and a crupper, etc. stencilled
with silver; for making a doublet for the
King of white linen cloth having about the
sleeves and bottom a border of green long
cloth wrought with clouds and vines of
gold and with the King's word <span class="blackletter">it. is. as.
it. is.</span></p>

<p>In 1380 Edmund Mortimer earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
March leaves 'our great bed of black
satin embroidered with white lions (the
badge of the house of March) and gold
roses with scutcheons of the arms of
Mortimer and Ulster'; and in 1385 Joan
princess of Wales leaves to King Richard
her son 'my new bed of red velvet embroidered
with ostrich feathers and leopards'
heads of gold with branches and leaves
issuing from their mouths.'</p>

<p>In 1389 William Pakington archdeacon
of Canterbury leaves 'my halling of red
with a shield of the King's arms in the
midst and with mine own arms in the
corners'; and in 1391 Margaret, the wife
of Sir William Aldeburgh, leaves (i) a red
halling with a border of blue with the arms
of Baliol and Aldeburgh, (ii) a red bed
embroidered with a tree and recumbent
lion and the arms of Aldeburgh and
Tillzolf, and (iii) a green bed embroidered
with griffins and the arms of Aldeburgh.</p>

<p>The inventory of Thomas of Woodstock
duke of Gloucester, taken in 1397, also
contains some interesting items: a white
halling (or set of hangings for a hall) consisting
of a dosser and four costers worked
with the arms of King Edward (his father)
and his sons with borders paly of red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
black powdered with Bohun swans and
the arms of Hereford; a great bed of gold,
that is to say, a coverlet, tester, and selour
of fine blue satin worked with gold Garters,
and three curtains of tartryn beaten with
Garters to match; and a large bed of white
satin embroidered in the midst with the
arms of the duke of Gloucester, with his
helm, in Cyprus gold.</p>

<p>A number of other items in the list are
also more or less heraldic: a bed of black
baudekyn powdered with white roses; a
large old bed of green tartryn embroidered
with gold griffins; twelve pieces of tapestry
carpet, blue with white roses in the corners
and divers arms; a large bed of blue
baudekyn embroidered with silver owls and
gold fleurs-de-lis; fifteen pieces of tapestry
for two rooms of red worsted embroidered
with blue Garters of worsted with helms
and arms of divers sorts; three curtains of
white tartryn with green popinjays; a
green bed of double samite with a blue
pale (stripe) of chamlet embroidered with
a pot of gold filled with divers flowers of
silver; an old bed of blue worsted embroidered
with a stag of yellow worsted; a red
bed of worsted embroidered with a crowned
lion and two griffins and chaplets and roses;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
a bed of blue worsted embroidered with a
white eagle; a coverlet and tester of red
worsted embroidered with a white lion
couching under a tree; a single gown of
blue cloth of gold of Cyprus powdered
with gold stags; and a single gown of red
cloth of gold of Cyprus with mermaids.</p>

<p>In 1381 William lord Latimer leaves
'an entire vestment or suit of red velvet
embroidered with a cross of mine arms,'
and in 1397 Sir Ralph Hastings bequeathed
'a vestment of red cloth of gold with
orphreys before and behind ensigned with
maunches and with colours of mine arms,'
which were a red maunch or sleeve on a
gold ground.</p>

<p>Among the chapel stuff of Henry Bowet
archbishop of York, in 1423, were a sudary
or veil of white cloth with the arms of the
duke of Lancaster on the ends, and two
costers or curtains of red embroidered with
great white roses and the arms of St. Peter
(the crossed keys).</p>

<p>In 1437 Helen Welles of York bequeathed
a blue tester with a couched stag
and the reason <i>Auxilium meum a Domino</i>.</p>

<p>In 1448 Thomas Morton, a canon of
York, left a halling with two costers of
green and red say paled with the arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
of archbishop Bowet; and in 1449 the inventory
of Dan John Clerk, a York
chaplain, mentions two covers of red say
having the arms of Dan Richard Scrope
and the keys of St. Peter worked upon
them.</p>

<p>To the examples worked with letters
may be added a bed with a carpet of red
and green with crowned M's, left about
1440 by a Beverley mason, who also had
another bed with a carpet of blue and green
with Katharine wheels; a vestment left in
1467, by Robert Est, a chantry priest in
York minster, of green worsted having
on the back two crowned letters, namely,
R and E; and a bequest in 1520 by
Thomas duke of Norfolk of 'our great
hangede bedde palyd with cloth of golde
whyte damask and black velvet, and
browdered with these two letters T. A.,'
being the initials of himself and his wife.</p>

<p>There is of course nothing to hinder at
the present day the principles embodied in
the foregoing examples, which could easily
be extended <i>ad infinitum</i>, from being carried
out in the same delightful way; and a small
exercise of ingenuity would soon devise a
like treatment of one's own arms, or the
use of a favourite device or flower, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
setting out of the family word, reason, or
motto.</p>

<p>The medieval passion for striped, paned,
or checkered hangings might also be
revived with advantage, and the mention
in 1391 of 'a bed of white and murrey
unded' shows that waved lines were as
tolerable as straight.</p>

has been said or any illustration given of
heraldry later than the reign of Henry VIII,
chiefly because little that is artistic can be
found afterwards. There are however
certain points about both Elizabethan and
Stewart heraldry that are worthy of notice,
especially when the old traditions have been
followed.</p>

<p>In the second quarter of the sixteenth
century decorative heraldry may be said to
have reached its climax, and such examples
as can be seen at Hengrave Hall, Hampton
Court, Athelhampton House, Cowdray
House, St. George's chapel in Windsor
Castle, King's College chapel at Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
and Henry VII's Lady chapel at Westminster,
or in the beautiful panel of
Henry VIII's arms at New Hall in Essex
(fig. <a href="#Fig_189">189</a>), are quite the finest of their kind.
Then comes a falling off, and though sporadic
cases in continuation of tradition may be
found, with the advent of the Renaissance
English heraldry underwent a complete
change.</p>

</div>

<p>One of the most notable differences
between the older and the later heraldry is
in the quality of the heraldry itself.</p>

<p>In the days when men devised arms for
themselves these were characterized by a
simplicity that held its own all through the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and well
down into the fifteenth century. But
following upon a privilege that had hitherto
been exercised by the King as a mark of
special honour, and in some rare cases even
by nobles, the heralds then began to assign
arms to such of the newly-rich who came
to the front after the Wars of the Roses
and were willing to pay for them. Henceforth
the artistic aspect of heraldry entered
upon a continuous decadent course.</p>

<p>The beginning is visible in the extraordinary
compositions devised and granted
to all sorts and conditions of men during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a><br /><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
the reign of Henry VIII. Such arms as
had been granted by Henry VI or Edward
IV, or even by the kings-of-arms in
the fifteenth century, still followed ancient
precedent, but the Tudor members of the
newly incorporated Heralds' College seem
to have struck out a line for themselves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_190"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="caption-hanging"><span class="smcap">Fig. 190.</span> Paving tile with arms and initials of
John Lyte (<i>c.</i> 1535), from Marten church,
Wilts.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A notable example is furnished by the
arms devised for cardinal Thomas Wulcy.
These, in token of his Suffolk origin, have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
for basis the engrailed cross upon a sable
field of the Uffords (to whom he was not
related), charged with the leopards' heads
of the de la Poles and a lion passant (perhaps
for England); to which is added a
gold chief, with a red Lancastrian rose, and
two of the Cornish choughs from the posthumous
arms of St. Thomas of Canterbury
in allusion to his Christian name!</p>

<p>The arms granted by Christopher Barker,
Garter, in 1536 to the city of Gloucester
afford another example. They consist of the
sword of state of the city, with the sword-bearer's
cap on the point, set upright on a
gold pale, and flanked on either side by a
silver horseshoe and a triad of horsenails
on a green field; there is also (as in Wulcy's
arms) a chief party gold and purple, with
the silver boar's head of Richard III (who
granted a charter to the city) between the
halves of a Lancastrian red rose and of a
Yorkist white rose, each dimidiated with a
golden sun!</p>

<p>A reference to Bedford's <i>Blazon of Episcopacy</i>
will show that the arms of a considerable
number of the bishops appointed
during the reigns of Henry VIII and
Edward VI were characterized by overcharged
chiefs like those just described,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
and these may be taken as typical of the
arms then being granted by the kings-of-arms.
The same passion for crowding the
shield is seen even in many of the less
elaborate arms that were occasionally
granted.</p>

<p>Things did not improve under Mary and
Elizabeth. Simple arms continued to be
issued from the College, but mixed with
such extravagant bursts as that of Laurence
Dalton, Norroy, who granted in January
1560-1 to the famous physician doctor
John Caius these arms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Golde semyd w^{th} flowre gentle in the
myddle of the cheyfe, sengrene resting
uppon the heades of ij serpentes in pale,
their tayles knytte to gether, all in proper
color, resting uppon a square marble stone
vert, betwene theire brestes a boke sable,
garnyshed gewles, buckles gold, and to
his crest upon thelme a Dove argent,
bekyd &amp; membred gewles, holding in
his beke by the stalke, flowre gentle in
propre color, stalked verte, set on a
wreth golde &amp; gewles.</p></div>

<p>This precious composition is further described
in the grant as</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

ij serpentes resting upon the square
marble stone, wisdom with grace founded
&amp; stayed upon vertues stable stone: by
sengrene &amp; flower gentle, immortality
y<sup>t</sup> never shall fade, etc.</p></div>

<p>The way in which matters went from bad
to worse is shown by the case of the Company
of 'Barbours &amp; Chirurgeons' of
London, to whom had been granted in 1561</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>paly argent and vert, on a pale gules a
lyon passant gardant golde betweene two
Spatters argent on eche a double rose
gules and argent crowned golde.</p></div>

<p>The united genius of Garter, Clarenceux,
and Norroy 'improved' these arms in
1569 into:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Quarterly the first sables a Cheveron
betweene three flewmes argent: the
second quarter per pale argent and vert
on a Spatter of the first, a double Rose
gules and argent crowned golde: the
third quarter as the seconde and the
fourth as the first: Over all on a Crosse
gules a lyon passant gardant golde.</p></div>

<p>Such compositions as these could not but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
fail to bring heraldry into contempt, and
men soon ceased to revel in and play with
it in the same delightful way as before.
Here and there, as in Sir Thomas Tresham's
market house at Rothwell, or in Sir Henry
Stafford's great mansion of Kirby Hall,
tradition has been held fast, and play is
made upon the former with the Tresham
trefoils, and in the latter with Stafford
knots and with crests treated as badges in
quite the old style. At Kirby Hall, despite
its date (1572-5), and at Cadhay in Devon,
sitting figures of beasts with shields of arms
were set upon the gables, and at Kirby upon
the pinnacles that surmounted the pilasters
about the court. A good panel with the
arms and badge apparently of Sir John
Guldeford (<i>ob.</i> 1565) is to be seen in East
Guldeford church, Sussex (fig. <a href="#Fig_191">191</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_191"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="caption-hanging"><span class="smcap">Fig. 191.</span> Arms, with crested helm and badge
(a blazing ragged-staff) of, apparently, Sir
John Guldeford of Benenden (<i>ob.</i> 1565) in
East Guldeford church, Sussex.</p></div>
</div>

<p>A remarkably fine specimen of Elizabethan
heraldic decoration is also to be
seen in the great chamber of Gilling castle,
Yorks, as finished by Sir William Fairfax
about 1585. Here the beautiful inlaid
wall-panelling is surmounted by a frieze
nearly four feet deep, painted with hunting
scenes and a series of large trees, upon
which are hung according to wapentakes
the shields of arms of Yorkshire gentlefolk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
The chimney piece displays the armorial
ensigns of the builder, with those of his
Queen above, and four other shields, and
between the frettings of the plaster ceiling
are the Fairfax lions and goats, and the
Stapleton talbot. The rich effect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
whole is completed by the contemporary
heraldic glazing with which the windows
happily are filled.</p>

<p>But in Elizabethan buildings generally,
heraldry made but a poor show. Supporters
and other creatures had descended
from the gables to stand or squat upon
gateposts, and occasionally a square panel
filled with heraldry was inset above a
doorway or a porch; or the family crest,
divorced from its helm, was carved upon
the spandrels of the entrance. But the
former glory had disappeared, and shields
of arms were often replaced by initials and
dates of owners and builders, presumably
because they were 'non-armigerous persons.'</p>

<p>Within doors matters were somewhat
better. Such gorgeous rooms as the great
chamber at Gilling were quite exceptional,
and heraldic display was usually confined
to the elaborately carved overmantels of
the chimneys, which served as a frame for
the family arms and crested helm with
grand flourishing of mantlings. These
were often repeated upon the cast-iron fire-backs.
The art of the plasterer was extended
to the inclusion of crests and other
devices among the ornaments of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
moulded ceilings, and the glazier continued
to fill the windows with beautiful coloured
shields of alliances. Occasionally too the
family arms were woven into carpets or
table covers; or embroidered by the ladies
of the house on the hangings of the state
bed, within charming wreaths of flowers
copied from those in the garden (fig. <a href="#Fig_192">192</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_192"></a>

</div>

<p>The monuments of the dead continue as
before to be adorned with heraldry, but in
a different way, and for the beautiful simple
arms and devices of the medieval memorial
began to be substituted the concentrated
shield of the family quarterings, with crest
and mantled helm, and such supporters as
the College of Arms allowed or approved.</p>

<p>Despite the inevitable consequent formality,
there is often much that is good
about the treatment of Elizabethan and
Jacobean heraldry, and it would not be
easy, even at an earlier date, to beat the
delightful lions upon the shields on the
Lennox tomb at Westminster (fig. <a href="#Fig_194">194</a>), or
to fill up more satisfactorily a shield like
that above the monument of Sir Ralph
Pecksall (fig. <a href="#Fig_195">195</a>). The effective way in
which the shield itself is treated in this case
is also praiseworthy, and both shields are
models of heraldic carving in low relief.</p>

</div>

<p>The Lennox and Pecksall shields are
likewise indicative of another characteristic
change, the desire to illustrate ancient
descent by the multiplication of quarterings.
The disastrous consequences of this
practice, even in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, have already been
pointed out, but in the reign of Elizabeth
it was carved to such an excess as to produce
at times a mere patchwork of carved
or painted quarters, in which the beauty of
the heraldry was entirely lost. In the
great hall of Fawsley House, Northants,
there hangs a coloured achievement of the
Knightley family containing actually 334<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a><br /><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a><br /><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
quarterings, which have been rightly
described by Mr. J. A. Gotch as '330 too
many for decorative effect.'</p>

<p>The heraldry of the seventeenth century
is in general but a duller version of that of
the later sixteenth century, with a tendency
to become more commonplace as time
goes on.</p>

<p>Under the Commonwealth every vestige
of regality was ordered to be put down
and done away; a very large number of
representations of the royal arms were defaced
and destroyed; and the leopards of
England were for a time 'driven into the
wilderness' along with the lion of Scotland.
It was nevertheless thought desirable that
the United Kingdom should still have
arms, and on <span class="smcap">THE GREAT SEALE OF ENGLAND/
IN THE FIRST YEARE OF FREEDOM BY GOD'S
BLESSING RESTORED</span>, that is, 1648, the cross
of St. George appears for England, and a
harp for Ireland. The royal crown was at
the same time superseded, on all maces
and other symbols of kingly power, by another
which curiously reproduces all its
elements. It had a circlet inscribed <span class="smcap">THE
FREEDOM OF ENGLAND BY GOD'S BLESSING
RESTORED</span>, with the date, and for the cresting
of crosses and fleurs-de-lis there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
substituted an intertwined cable enclosing
small cartouches with the cross of St.
George and the Irish harp. The new
crown was also arched over, with four
graceful incurved members like ostrich
feathers, but wrought with oak leaves and
acorns. These supported a pyramidal
group of four handsome cartouches with
the cross and harp surrounded by an acorn,
instead of the orb and cross.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Perfect
examples of this singular republican crown
still surmount the two maces of the town
of Weymouth.</p>

<p>On the obverse of the new great seal of
the Commonwealth, designed and engraved
by Simon and first used in 1655, the field
is filled with an heraldic achievement of
some interest (fig. <a href="#Fig_196">196</a>). This includes
a shield with the cross of St. George in the
first and fourth quarters, St. Andrew's cross
in the second quarter, and the Irish harp in
the third quarter, with the lion of Cromwell
on a scutcheon of pretence. This shield of
the State's arms is supported by a lion with
a royal crown on his head, and by a dragon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a><br /><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a><br /><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
standing upon the edge of a ribbon with
the motto <span class="smcap">PAX QVÆRITVR BELLO</span>, and is
surmounted by a front-faced helm with
much flourished mantling, with a royal
crown and the crowned leopard crest above,
set athwart the helm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;"><a id="Fig_196"></a>
<a href="images/i_219.jpg"><img src="images/i_219_tn.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt=""

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 196</span>. Obverse of the Great Seal of the Republic
of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1655.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The seal furnishes an excellent illustration
of the heraldic art of the period, but
it is singular that under a Nonconformist
domination the arms selected for England
and Scotland should consist of the crosses
of their patron saints. It is also interesting
to note that the expunged arms of
England and Scotland had evidently been
regarded rightly as personal to the
murdered King. A further curious point
is the reappearance on the seal of the royal
crown of England above the helm and on
the leopard crest and the lion supporter.</p>

<p>On the reverse of the seal just noted
the State's new arms are repeated on a
cartouche behind the equestrian figure of
the Protector.</p>

<p>Of the heraldry of the Restoration and
later it is hardly necessary to make mention,
so lifeless and dull is the generality of
it. A good specimen <i>c.</i> 1670 with the
arms of the Trinity House (fig. <a href="#Fig_197">197</a>),
and a later one (fig. <a href="#Fig_198">198</a>) with the arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
etc. of the Trevor family, are to be
seen in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Reference is due, too, to one other notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a><br /><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
example. This is the beautiful panelled
ceiling set up over the chapel (formerly the
great hall) of Auckland castle, by doctor
John Cosin bishop of Durham (fig. <a href="#Fig_199">199</a>).
It was in making from 1662 to 1664, by
a local carpenter, and consists for the most
part of a series of square panels containing
alternately the cross and four lions that
form the arms of the bishopric of Durham,
and the fret forming the arms of Cosin.
In the middle bay the bishop's arms are
given in an oval, and flanked by similar
ovals with the eagle of St. John in allusion
to his name. No earlier wooden ceiling
could be finer in conception, and the effect
of the whole was originally enhanced by
colour and gilding, but this was most unhappily
removed by order of bishop
Barrington (1791-1826).</p>

<p>With so notable a late survival of
medieval tradition this book may fitly end.</p>
